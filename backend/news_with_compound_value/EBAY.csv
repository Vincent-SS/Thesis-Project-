 Stephanie Popp, former senior manager of global intelligence; and Veronica Zea, a former eBay contractor who worked as an intelligence analyst in eBay's Global Intelligence Center, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit cyberstalking and conspiracy to tamper with witnesses. They are scheduled to be sentenced in February. 
 They are among seven former eBay employees charged in the scheme that involved other anonymous deliveries sent to the couple's home, including a funeral wreath and a bloody pig Halloween mask. Three others are expected to plead guilty later this month 
 The employees also sent pornographic magazines with the husband's name on them to their neighbor's house, planned to break into the couple's garage to install a GPS device on their car, and posted the couple's names and address online, advertising things like yard sales and encouraging strangers to knock on the door if the pair wasn't outside, officials said. 
 The couple was targeted after their newsletter published an article about a lawsuit filed by eBay accusing Amazon of poaching its sellers, investigators said.

 ""Four former employees of #eBay are scheduled to plead guilty on Oct. 8 at 2pm via zoom in federal court in #Boston,"" according to a tweet from the official account of the U.S. attorney's office in Massachusetts. ""The defendants are charged w/ participating in a cyberstalking campaign that targeted a Massachusetts couple."" 
 The four expected to plead guilty are Brian Gilbert, 51; Stephanie Popp, 32; Stephanie Stockwell, 26; and Veronica Zea, 26, according to The Boston Globe. 
 All live in San Jose, California, except for Stockwell, who lives in Redwood City, California. 
 They are among seven former eBay employees charged in the case, in which the Massachusetts couple had other disturbing items sent to their home, including a funeral wreath and a bloody pig Halloween mask. 
 They are all charged with conspiracy to commit cyberstalking and conspiracy to tamper with a witness. Their lawyers either declined to comment or didn't immediately return emails seeking comment Wednesday. 
 The employees also sent pornographic magazines with the husband's name on them to their neighbor's house, planned to break into the couple's garage to install a GPS device on their car, and posted the couple's names and address online, advertising things like yard sales and encouraging strangers to knock on the door if the pair wasn't outside, officials said.

EBAY,2020-08-20,Adyen Clinches Wirecard Clients During Online Shopping Boom,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Adyen NV said it poached new merchants from embattled German payments firm Wirecard AG, as the Dutch company reported a 27% rise in revenue for the first half of the year.The scandal that plagued competitor Wirecard proved to be a boost in Adyen’s favor. Retail merchants looked for payment processing alternatives following the German company’s spectacular collapse in June, when Wirecard filed for insolvency after admitting that almost 2 billion euros ($2.37 billion) previously reported as cash didn’t exist.“We certainly got some inbound from merchants that wanted to work with us,” Adyen Chief Financial Officer Ingo Uytdehaage said in an interview. They were primarily in the Asia-Pacific region, he said.Partnerships with a couple of former Wirecard clients are already live, while Adyen is still in talks with many others, the finance chief said. Some are “really well-known brands” that “wanted to convert quickly,” he said, declining to name specific new merchants.But, Uytdehaage said, the Wirecard scandal overall was “not good for trust in the industry.”Nonetheless, that same industry remains buoyant during the pandemic as more shoppers rely on contactless cards and ecommerce while shunning cash. Amsterdam-based Adyen, which processes payments for firms including Uber Technologies Inc. and EBay Inc., has benefitted from the trend, leading its shares to double this year even as Amsterdam’s AEX Index has declined 7.3%.On Thursday, the company reported 279.9 million euros in net revenue for the first half of the year, beating average analyst expectations of 274.2 million euros. The Amsterdam-based company said it processed 129.1 billion euros of payments for the period, an increase of 23% from last year. Analysts on average had expected processed volumes of 127.15 billion euros for the period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Despite the wins, there were some bruises for the Dutch company in the first half, particularly in the travel industry, where traffic has cratered due to the pandemic. Uytdehaage said the company is starting to see a rebound from online booking platforms with more people taking holidays in their local regions but “it’s absolutely not at the levels before Covid started,” he said.Adyen expects to continue to benefit from an accelerating trend from cash toward cards, even as customers start to trickle back into brick-and-mortar stores, Uytdehaage said, pointing to government incentives for customers to pay with cards or smartphones. The Amsterdam-based company offers merchants payments processing both online and in stores and in a variety of local payments methods.The finance chief confirmed the company’s outlook, and said it continues to hire new employees, growing its workforce to around 1,500 people by the end of the second quarter.Adyen still expects to grow net revenue at a rate between the mid-20s and low-30s in the medium term. It also plans to increase its annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization margin to above 55% in the long term. The company doesn’t define what it perceives as medium or long-term.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adyen-clinches-wirecard-clients-during-053612716.html,0.0,0.9872

Inc. among other companies, announced on Friday they are founding The Buy Safe America Coalition to back legislation that would require digital marketplaces to verify information about third-party merchants.The lobbying push by retailers will only add to the scrutiny facing companies such as Amazon and EBay Inc. over their role in allowing counterfeit products from bicycles to jeans to be sold around the world. Lawmakers, President Donald Trump and companies have all been exploring ways to curb the deluge of fake goods online.The goal is “to continue to raise awareness about counterfeit and stolen goods,” among lawmakers in Washington and statehouses around the country, said Michael Hanson, senior executive vice president of public affairs for the Retail Leaders Industry Association, one of the coalition’s founding members. “Now, with the growth of people buying online because of this pandemic, it seems that this is getting worse.”In addition to RILA, the Toy Association, American Apparel & Footwear Association, the Fashion Jewelry and Accessories Trade Association and other industry groups are also joining the coalition.Together they are backing the so-called INFORM Consumers Act, which would require digital marketplaces to collect information about some third-party sellers such as their government ID, tax ID and bank account details. The legislation also would direct companies to disclose to shoppers their high-volume sellers’ names, phone numbers, business addresses and emails. The bill defines high-volume sellers as firms that make 200 or more sales in a year amounting to $5,000 or more. Senators Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, and Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, introduced the bill in March. Democratic Representatives Jan Schakowksy of Illinois and Kathy Castor of Florida introduced a companion version in July.“The retailers, many of them are fighting for their lives, and they want to have as even a playing field as possible,” Schakowsky told Bloomberg earlier this summer, referring to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on business. “I think equally, consumers are really hoping that they’re going to be able to get the same protections online” as they do at brick and mortar stores, she said.Amazon didn’t respond to a request for comment.Amazon and Apple have acknowledged that counterfeit goods can be sold on their platforms, but say they invest in tools to identify fake listings and support law enforcement in their investigations of fraudulent sellers. Amazon announced in July that it would begin displaying sellers’ business names and addresses on their profile pages starting Sept. 1.Hanson and Rebecca Mond, vice president of federal government affairs at the Toy Association, said Amazon’s new policy doesn’t go far enough because the company isn’t committing to verifying the contact information it receives from the sellers.The proliferation of pirated and counterfeit goods on the internet has also caught the attention of the White House. The Department of Homeland Security in January recommended that the Trump administration seek permission to take legal action against third-party marketplaces that sell counterfeit merchandise, better track packages mailed from other countries and launch a consumer-awareness campaign, among other measures.The Department’s report also called on tech companies to more aggressively screen their vendors and create restrictions on products that are more likely to be counterfeited.“The costs that companies have to invest into protecting their brand and to policing these online marketplaces. I mean these are not insignificant costs,” said Mond. “The time to rely on voluntary measures or enforcement is done. We need to be looking at what needs to be implemented proactively to stop these products from getting up on the marketplace in the first place.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retailers-launch-lobbying-group-fight-080000690.html,-0.296,0.9473

EBAY,2020-08-12,Amazon Wins Loyal Walmart Shoppers as Americans Stampede Online,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Walmart Inc. shoppers are a pretty loyal bunch. But when virus-spooked Americans began avoiding stores earlier this year and shifting spending online, far more Walmart customers went to Amazon.com Inc. than Walmart.com.So even though Walmart, too, has thrived as an essential service amid the pandemic, Amazon is benefiting more.In the first week of February, for every dollar shoppers spent with the two rivals, 66 cents went to Walmart and 34 cents to Amazon, according to Facteus, which tracks credit and debit-card spending for millions of shoppers. In the first week of August, that gap narrowed to 55 cents to Walmart and 45 cents to Amazon. Walmart, through a spokesman, declined to comment.When the coronavirus began spreading across the the U.S., Amazon stumbled at first. Shipping times lengthened; multiple products were out of stock. Some reports said the company’s vaunted customer service metrics were starting to slip. Amazon responded by hiring 175,000 people to keep its operations running as existing employees sickened or stayed away for fear of catching Covid-19.The strategy, which included stepped-up safety measures in warehouses, eased investors’ fears. But few predicted the second-quarter earnings report that shattered Wall Street’s already optimistic expectations and forecast a continued surge in demand even as stores start to re-open. The shares have advanced more than 65% this year, compared with a 3% gain for the S&P 500.Turns out the online retail giant was perfectly situated to take advantage of a sudden shift in consumer behavior that, according to McKinsey, has compressed 10 years worth of online sales growth into three months. Amazon’s easily searchable website packed with hundreds of millions of products that can be delivered from warehouses scattered across the country stood out more than ever when the malls and Main Street went dark. And shoppers suddenly became quite forgiving of delivery delays. More than 8 in 10 thought holdups of a few days or longer were reasonable given the outbreak, according to a survey of 500 Amazon consumers conducted in June by Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Goat Consulting.As always, consumers are mostly mission-shopping at Amazon—hitting the site with a list that now includes everything from hand wipes and masks to above-ground pools and home-office furniture. But another trend has emerged too. People who once trolled the mall with no particular product in mind are starting to do the same on Amazon, which hasn't previously been known for window shopping. Consider the surge in demand for shelves shaped like coffins and gigantic stuffed panthers—classic retail therapy for a panicked populace.“Rather than price-compare or look for alternatives, a large portion of the U.S. population—as well as in other core Amazon markets—defaulted to Amazon,” says Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of Marketplace Pulse, a New York research firm that monitors the site. “They were able to default to Amazon because of its vast selection, so even as people went from shopping for masks to toilet paper to webcams to dumbbells to inflatable pools and back, Amazon had it. It’s not that other retailers didn’t have the same products at similar prices. The key was that customers didn’t look elsewhere.”Of course, other retailers allowed to stay open throughout the pandemic have benefited, too. Walmart, Target Corp. and Costco Wholesale Corp. have all gobbled up sales lost by shuttered stores, allowing them to grow even when consumers cut overall spending in response to rising joblessness and a tenuous economy. But Amazon has outperformed them all. Its website attracted 2.57 billion visitors in July, more than EBay Inc., Walmart, Etsy, Home Depot, Target and Best Buy combined, according to Marketplace Pulse.Amazon has become a substitute for entire industries. Foodies turned to it for new kitchen appliances after their favorite restaurants closed. Hair dye sales surged because people couldn’t go to salons. Many Americans are finally starting that garden since they have nothing else to do. All of these factors combined to propel second-quarter sales 40%  to $88.9 billion.The big question for investors is whether Amazon’s sales spike will endure. The economy is still struggling, and it doesn't help that Congress is deadlocked on a fresh round of stimulus spending and an extension of unemployment benefits. There’s also little doubt that some of the buying on Amazon and elsewhere is related to the pandemic and could fade. In a survey of 1,000 U.S. shoppers conducted last week, more than half said they’ve made online purchases as a way to relieve stress, says Vivek Pandya, Senior Digital Insights Manager at Adobe Digital Insights.That could explain the strong demand for those coffin-shaped shelves, which are sold as a kind of gag by Helium 10, an Irvine, California-based company that makes e-commerce tools. Ditto for the spike in sales of giant stuffed animals.  “Whether people are just looking for something large and comforting during these uncertain times or they’re just bored and think a giant panther would look good in that empty space in their living room, I don’t know,” says Macy Frazier, an operations analyst at Viahart, the Canton, Texas-based merchant that sells them. “There’s just something going on.""Retail therapy exists in good times as well as bad. And when the pandemic ends, Amazon will inherit a landscape decimated by dozens of retail bankruptcies, including department store chain J.C. Penney Co., clothing retailer Lord & Taylor, furniture and housewares seller Pier 1 Imports Inc. and Modell’s Sporting Goods Inc. It’s telling—and a potentially ominous sign for these retailers—that Amazon’s subscription services surged 30% last quarter. Most of that is new Prime members, who will be hard to dislodge once the battered chains emerge from Chapter 11 with fewer stores.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-wins-loyal-walmart-shoppers-100004459.html,0.6908,0.992

Consumer technology platform SoleSavy plans to disrupt this paradigm, though, causing huge interest in how to invest in SoleSavy stock.Source: 2p2play / Shutterstock.com At the core of the company's business is its namesake app. Offered in both a free-for-all format along with exclusive benefits for premium members, the app connects users to the latest news and official release dates of highly anticipated sneakers. Of course, it's the premium membership, which is offered at $30 per month or $300 a year, where true aficionados receive the most benefit.As SoleSavy's pitch deck points out, popular sneakers can command ridiculous charge ups in the second-hand market. To avoid this price hike, consumers have to be front of the line when new sneakers are released. The problem is, hot sneakers sell out in seconds, benefiting only scalpers and leaving genuine collectors frustrated.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, SoleSavy levels the playing field by connecting its exclusive members with retail partners. As soon products drop or are restocked, the SoleSavy app notifies its members, allowing them to purchase in-demand footwear at MSRP, not a 50% or more markup.Because of the great value proposition, people who aren't necessarily interested in sneakers are still clamoring to invest in SoleSavy stock. Offered on equity crowdfunding platform Seedinvest.com, you now have that chance. Invest in SoleSavy Stock to Connect Brands with FansFor those who are not aware of the massive sneaker fanbase, the idea of paying a premium to know when to buy shoes may seem preposterous. But look a little deeper and you'll start to recognize why so many folks wish to invest in SoleSavy stock.First, you have the size and growth of the sneaker market. According to Value Market Research, by the end of 2020, it forecasts global sneaker sales to hit nearly $77 billion. To put this into perspective, Nike's revenue in 2019 was $37.4 billion. Its international rival Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) generated $26.3 billion last year.  * 7 Travel Stocks to Buy Banking On Pent-Up Demand Moreover, Value Market Research estimates that worldwide sneaker sales will reach nearly $98 billion by 2024. Clearly, you can't grow a retail segment this large without a strong, loyal consumer base. Hence, SoleSavy serves to disrupt this space by focusing largely on the consumer experience.Personally, I believe this consumer-centric business model is the biggest catalyst for those who want to invest in SoleSavy stock. Prior to this app, it was the retail platform that profited the most from the sneaker fanbase, whether that be a producer via a direct retail channel or a secondhand market like eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).Either way, consumers came last. With direct retail, only those with the biggest pocketbooks could gain access to the shoes. And with secondhand markets, the premiums could be outrageous.But SoleSavy took a different approach, leveraging the connections and technology of the big boys to offer far better deals to everyday collectors and users. In exchange, SoleSavy charges a small monthly fee.However, if you're a true sneaker connoisseur, the fees more than pay for themselves. Equity Crowdfunding Risks to ConsiderBefore you pull the trigger and invest in SoleSavy stock, you should consider important risk factors. First, as an equity crowdfunding play, you're tying up your money. Therefore, you must consider the opportunity cost associated with this private investing offer.And it's a big cost as well, with the minimum investment being $10,000. Further, this is the first seed in the company's funding initiative. Management intends to use the raised funds to ""scale the business, expand our technology offerings and continue to monetize all aspects of the industry."" While an exciting proposition, it's also very risky.Another point to consider is that while SoleSavy's growth rate is impressive, the nominal baseline may be low, depending on overhead. Though the company has more than 1,875 customers in North America, this figure needs to accelerate quickly (1,875 x $30/month = $56,250/month), especially if it's going to expand aggressively.Also, while the global sneaker market is massive, one wonders what impact the novel coronavirus will have on sentiment. Right now, purchasing sneakers is a luxury of luxuries, especially with millions of Americans facing eviction risks. Unfortunately, the timing may not be favorable to invest in SoleSavy stock. A Consumer-Driven BusinessAt the end of the day, SoleSavy is all about the consumer, not big business. That approach has appealed to its small but rapidly growing user base.As well, a quick look at Nike shares has demonstrated that the footwear and athletic apparel business is resilient, even in the face of a potential economic crisis. Naturally, this will embolden those who elect this private investing opportunity.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies. Over the past several years, he has delivered unique, critical insights for the investment markets, as well as various other industries including legal, construction management, and healthcare. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

EBAY,2020-08-03,Amazon’s Market Power to Be Investigated by New York AG,,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Attorneys general from New York and California are partnering with the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Amazon.com Inc.’s online marketplace, according to people familiar with the matter, ratcheting up scrutiny of the world’s largest e-commerce company.The three agencies will work together to interview witnesses in coming weeks on joint conference calls, the people said. Bloomberg reported on the FTC investigation last year, and California’s probe was revealed in a court filing last week. The New York investigation and collaboration among agencies at the state and federal level hasn’t previously been reported.State and federal regulators cooperating can often precede a big antitrust enforcement action, similar to that taken against Microsoft Corp, said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.“This appears to be taking the shape of what could be a major collaborative antitrust investigation,” she said. “This happens in big cases where the feds have a stake in enforcing the law, and also when states have an interest in protecting their constituents.”Through spokespeople, Amazon, the FTC and the offices of California’s and New York’s AGs all declined to comment.New York Attorney General Letitia James is also investigating the termination of Chris Smalls, who led a demonstration at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island. Amazon has said Smalls and three other activist workers were fired for violating company policy.Amazon is among four big technology companies being scrutinized for allegedly abusing their market power. Along with the chief executives of Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc., Amazon’s Jeff Bezos testified last week before a House committee probing antitrust allegations.Almost 40 cents of every dollar spent online in the U.S. goes to Amazon, which has more of the online retail market than its nine closest competitors including Walmart Inc. and EBay Inc. combined, according to EMarketer Inc. Amazon, which denies abusing its market position, has said it represents a small fraction of total U.S. retail sales.(Updates with background starting in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-market-power-investigated-york-181030742.html,0.0,0.2255
