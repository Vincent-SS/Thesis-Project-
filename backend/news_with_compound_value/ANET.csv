Además creen que que permitiría agilizar trámites en el ámbito público y privado, con la emisión de certificados electrónicos cualificados. Y que esto a su vez permitiría un ahorro y una mejora de la eficiencia sustancial para la administración, y aflorar una parte considerable de la economía sumergida, liberando casi un 14% del PIB.Expertos de España y Latinoamérica analizarán desafíos y oportunidades de blockchain en el sector financiero En ese contexto, destacaron cinco claves para entender la importancia de la identidad digital en España. A continuación los detalles según AEFI:*eIDAS, una directiva pendiente de desarrollar en EspañaEl eIDAS (reglamento europeo que establece un marco jurídico común para los servicios de confianza y los medios de identificación electrónica) se aprobó en 2016, pero todavía no se aplica en su potencialidad en España. Supone para la identidad lo que fue el euro para la moneda en 1999: la homogeneización de un asunto fundamental para la creación de un Mercado Único Digital. Se trata del germen del DNI europeo, con el que más de 500 millones de ciudadanos y miles de empresas podrán realizar transacciones electrónicas seguras y confiables, que antes requerían un acto de identificación en presencia física, pero ahora de manera online, estableciendo un marco de actuación totalmente novedoso y un lenguaje económico común para las operaciones entre administración, empresas y ciudadanos.  Registraron la marca y el logotipo de Bitcoin en la Oficina Española de Patentes y Marcas*España, una anomalía en EuropaEl “Real Decreto-Ley 11/2020, de 31 de marzo, por el que se adoptaron medidas urgentes complementarias en el ámbito social y económico para hacer frente al COVID-19, autorizó la emisión de certificados electrónicos cualificados por parte de los Prestadores Cualificados de Servicios de Confianza, de forma totalmente online. Sin embargo, unas puntualizaciones restrictivas, realizadas por la Subdirección General para la Sociedad Digital, limitaban el efecto de esta autorización, acotando sus usos y ordenando la revocación de los certificados, una vez finalizara el estado de alarma.*La digitalización de la Administración, una asignatura pendienteEspaña no supera el 20% de madurez en la digitalización de la Administración Pública, si se tiene en cuenta el grado de avance de los trámites digitales y el uso por la parte de los ciudadanos. La cantidad de identidades, DNIe y certificados FNMT existentes mantienen un uso casi residual (menos del 1%), debido a la dificultad de uso y de acceso a la misma, encontrándose este uso circunscrito principalmente a trámites obligatorios para autónomos y empresas con la Agencia Tributaria.Sectores regulados como el financiero o el de las telecomunicaciones ya pueden adquirir clientes online en cualquier momento y parte del mundo y la Administración Pública lo necesitará en el escenario post-covid19, para apoyar la reactivación de la economía y facilitar el acceso a los ciudadanos a sus servicios. Se estima que el Mercado Único Digital podrá generar más de 30 Billones de euros en el mercado europeo en los próximos cinco años, convirtiéndose en el principal impulsor de la competencia en sectores clave de la economía, incluida la Administración Pública, favoreciendo los servicios en sectores tales como el financiero, el sanitario, las telecomunicaciones, la economía colaborativa, el paso de fronteras, el transporte y la movilidad e incluso la democracia electrónica y la participación ciudadana.Tras levantar más de 72 millones de euros, llega a España la fintech danesa Pleo*España, un país pionero en soluciones de identificación que no aprovecha su ventaja competitivaPese al retraso en la aplicación de la normativa comunitaria eiDAS, España fue un país pionero en la implantación de soluciones que permitían la identificación a distancia aceptadas e impulsadas por el SEPBLA que, durante el año 2019 en España, permitieron identificar a más de un millón de usuarios en el mercado financiero con máximo nivel de seguridad. No obstante, esta ventaja competitiva que permite la normativa está quedando relegada frente a modelos como el italiano o el alemán, pese a que dichos sistemas, son más ineficientes y se encuentran en retroceso por su alto coste y complejidad. En este sentido, algunos Prestadores de Servicios de Confianza españoles están ya están notando los efectos de esta falta de visión, siendo adquiridos por prestadores homólogos de otros países que no cuentan con tantas ataduras en el reto digital.*El desarrollo de la identidad digital, un elemento vital para impulsar la economía y apoyar la transformación de la sociedad y los nuevos modelos productivos en el escenario post COVID-19La identidad digital, sencilla de obtener y fácil de usar, a pleno rendimiento, permitiría que el Estado pudiera funcionar en tiempo real y liberar un impacto de hasta un 13,6% del PIB, según un estudio elaborado por Mc Kinsey (...). Además, la identidad digital es clave en la introducción de la moneda y pagos electrónicos, para eliminar el dinero en papel, lo que podría suponer un ahorro de 600 millones anuales. Te puede interesar:Expertos de España y Latinoamérica analizarán desafíos y oportunidades de blockchain en el sector financieroRegistraron la marca y el logotipo de Bitcoin en la Oficina Española de Patentes y MarcasTras levantar más de 72 millones de euros, llega a España la fintech danesa PleoFintech estoniana askRobin sale a competir en América LatinaEspaña: La CNMV advierte sobre varias entidades no autorizadas para prestar servicios de inversiónBitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Monero, TRON: Análisis de precios, 26 de noviembre (2018)Desde Paxful afirman que se registró un significativo incremento del intercambio de criptomonedas en Argentina",https://blockboard.net/es/cinco-claves-para-entender-la-importancia-de-la-identidad-digital-en-espana/,0.0,-0.765

Jesús Rodríguez, CEO de IntoTheBlock, y Daniel Ferraro, head of Marketing de la firma, compartieron con Cointelegraph en Español, las lecciones aprendidas sobre este tema.“Fracasamos mucho, aprendimos mucho y pudimos lograr resultados muy prometedores. Algunos de los modelos predictivos iniciales pronto estarán disponibles en la plataforma IntoTheBlock”, señalaron. Y luego contaron detalles sobre lo aprendido. “Las predicciones de precios son, en muchas formas, la máxima expresión de la cripto analítica. Muchas de las métricas e indicadores que usamos regularmente tienen la intención de ayudarnos a formular una tesis predictiva sobre el mercado. Los algoritmos de predicción de precios son solo una forma programática de abstraer esas tesis en el modelo de aprendizaje automático”, comentaron.COO de IntoTheBlock: ”Europa es un centro de suma importancia en la industria de blockchain y cripto”Predicciones de precios para criptoactivos en tres pasosSegún lo detallado por Rodríguez y Ferraro, el proceso para crear modelos de deep learning para criptoactivos se puede resumir en tres pasos:1) ¿Qué predecir? Formulación de una tesis de predicción.2) ¿Cómo predecirlo? Construyendo un modelo de predicción.3) ¿Cómo ejecutar la predicción? Operacionalizar un modelo de predicción. Formulación de una tesis de predicción“Hay muchos aspectos de los mercados de capitales que pueden ser el objetivo de los modelos de predicción. Precio, riesgo, impulso, valor, dirección del precio son algunos de los ejemplos más notables. Seleccionar un objetivo de predicción es un primer paso clave de cualquier estrategia de predicción”, remarcaron.Otro elemento importante para formular una tesis de predicción es decidir qué fuente de datos utilizar. En el caso de los criptoactivos, las fuentes de datos centrales que Rodríguez y Ferraron consideraron y que pueden contener predicción alfa son:Registros de blockchain.Data de los order books de los exchanges con spot trading.Data de los order books de exchanges de derivados.“En nuestra experiencia, cada uno de esos conjuntos de datos tiene ventajas y desventajas. Por ejemplo, los conjuntos de datos de blockchain son excelentes para descubrir oportunidades alfa únicas, pero son realmente ineficientes en modelos predictivos de alta a media frecuencia. Por otro lado, el estado inmaduro actual de los mercados de derivados criptográficos ofrece oportunidades alfa sistemáticas que son extrañas de descubrir con sólo conjuntos de datos de blockchain”, indicaron. El siguiente diagrama ilustra una perspectiva sobre la forma en que estos tres tipos de conjuntos de datos criptográficos se alinean con los modelos predictivos. IntoTheBlock y Dash Core Group anunciaron una alianza para proporcionar analítica a usuarios de DashCrear modelos predictivosEl segundo paso en el proceso de creación de estrategias predictivas es seleccionar un enfoque de modelado predictivo. Es así que afirmaron que, en el estado actual del espacio de la ciencia de datos, hay tres metodologías fundamentales que deben considerarse:Predicción de series de tiempoMachine LearningDeep Learning“Nuestra experiencia actual aplicando métodos de pronóstico de series temporales a los criptoactivos mostró que, aunque son relativamente fáciles de usar, no son muy resistentes a las fluctuaciones constantes del mundo de crypto”, aclararon.Por otra parte, comentaron que los métodos tradicionales de machine learning, como la regresión lineal o los árboles de decisión, tienen una fuerte presencia en los sistemas cuantitativos tradicionales y, por lo tanto, uno puede parecer inclinado a extrapolar esas lecciones al mundo o espacio de crypto. “Sin embargo, descubrimos que esos métodos tienen un gran desafío de generalización y no han demostrado ser muy resistentes a las condiciones del mercado”, subrayaron.También dijeron que las redes neuronales profundas (deep neural networks) son la última tendencia en el espacio de inteligencia artificial (IA) y lo que se ha desarrollado más rápidamente. En ese contexto, contaron: “En los últimos años, el cuerpo de investigación en deep learning ha aumentado drásticamente. La promesa de las redes neuronales profundas es que pueden descubrir complejas relaciones no lineales entre variables arbitrarias. En nuestra experiencia, los modelos de deep learning en criptoactivos han demostrado una fuerte resistencia a las condiciones del mercado y la capacidad de generalizar el conocimiento. El mayor inconveniente es que este tipo de modelos son computacionalmente caros de producir y muy difíciles de entender e interpretar cómo producen decisiones”. Entrevista al creador del juego CryptoPlay: “Me gustaría que la gente esté preparada para toda la tecnología que viene” 10 lecciones sobre la ejecución de modelos cripto predictivos en producciónConstruir una pipeline de predicción que sea robusto es una tarea difícil. Muchos de los modelos que funcionan muy bien en un entorno de laboratorio o de práctica resultarán difíciles de poner en funcionamiento. A continuación se presentan algunas lecciones que escribieron Rodríguez y Ferraro, que pueden ser relevantes al considerar la implementación de modelos de deep learning:El tamaño del entrenamiento importa: cuando se trata de activos criptográficos, cuanto mayor sea el conjunto de datos para entrenar modelos, mejor.La calidad de los datos es un gran problema para los criptoactivos: es muy difícil encontrar fuentes de datos confiables en el espacio de cifrado.Las predicciones precisas no significan predicciones viables: una indicación de movimiento direccional en el precio no es una estrategia comercial.Operar las predicciones en tiempo real es difícil: ejecutar modelos de aprendizaje profundo en tiempo real requiere bastante infraestructura.Los modelos predictivos basados ​​en blockchain son muy frágiles: los modelos predictivos blockchain son muy vulnerables a las manipulaciones de intercambio, los tenedores y otros cambios en el tiempo de ejecución que pueden afectar su rendimiento.Decidir cuándo y cómo volver a entrenar a los modelos es un desafío: volver a entrenar a los modelos predictivos después de que estén en producción puede cambiar su rendimiento de maneras inesperadas.La experimentación rápida es clave:  la construcción de modelos predictivos para criptoactivos es un negocio de fracaso. Probar diferentes ideas rápidamente e iterar es esencial para el éxito.La fuente de datos en Crypto es muy poco confiable: fallas en los intercambios, falta de datos, lavado de registros comerciales son algunos de los elementos que afectan la confiabilidad de las fuentes de datos utilizadas en los modelos predictivos criptográficos.Una mejor infraestructura supera a mejores modelos: una infraestructura robusta con modelos mediocres vencerá a una infraestructura pobre con excelentes modelos a largo plazo.La mayoría de las investigaciones cuantitativas falla cuando se aplica a crypto: la mayoría de las técnicas en trabajos de investigación no fueron diseñadas para la dinámica de los mercados de criptoactivos.“Estas son algunas de las lecciones prácticas que hemos aprendido al construir modelos predictivos en el espacio de criptoactivos”, concluyeron.Cabe destacar que en los próximos días estarán lanzando una nueva sección de modelos predicticos en la plataforma app.intotheblock.comTe puede interesar:COO de IntoTheBlock: ”Europa es un centro de suma importancia en la industria de blockchain y cripto”IntoTheBlock y Dash Core Group anunciaron una alianza para proporcionar analítica a usuarios de DashEntrevista al creador del juego CryptoPlay: “Me gustaría que la gente esté preparada para toda la tecnología que viene” Análisis de precios, 04 de junio: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar, IOTA  (2018)Análisis de precios, 01 de junio: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar, IOTA (2018)Plataforma de banca abierta Tink adquiere a la empresa española Eurobits para expandirse por Europa y LatinoaméricaWirecard repunta casi un 200% en Bolsa por posible interés de compra de otras empresas",https://blockboard.net/es/que-podemos-aprender-de-los-modelos-predictivos-para-activos-criptograficos/,0.0,-0.787

Los eventos recientes que rodearon el lanzamiento del token de Compound parecen haber sido notados por muchos otros proyectos en el ecosistema de finanzas descentralizadas o DeFi.En una entrevista con Cointelegraph, el cofundador de Framework Ventures, Michael Anderson, dijo que el éxito del token puede proporcionar un ejemplo a seguir por otros proyectos DeFi, que pueden comenzar a involucrarse en ""guerras de agricultura de rendimiento"".Joaquin Morinigo: “Bitcoin es básicamente el oro de mi generación, de la Generación Z”El resultado de esto podría ser un mayor interés en el espacio DeFi en si, argumenta Anderson. Algunos de esos resultados ya se pueden ver en los exponenciales crecimientos en los precios de otros tokens, como LEND de Aave, y SNX de Synthetix.Si bien el sistema de recompensas de Compound no es el primero en su tipo, su éxito tan extremadamente rápido lo coloca por encima de los ejemplos anteriores.Colocándole un precio al éxito futuroAnderson comparó a Compound, con una ""startup en una etapa intermedia que está alcanzando un crecimiento en sus ingresos"", lo que genera mucho interés en el mundo de las inversiones tradicionales:""Asumes que las operaciones crecen y la infectividad de esos ingresos aumenta, lo que significa que eventualmente pueden llegar a ser, ya sabes, tan rentables como algunos de los grandes como Google y Facebook que pasaron por esa transición"".Según él, los inversores del token de Compound creen en ""lo que pueda suceder"" y en cómo el crecimiento de las DeFi, y el reconocimiento de la plataforma, podrían hacer que las valoraciones de miles de millones de dólares se vuelvan algo concreto.Análisis de precios al 26/06: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, BSV, LTC, BNB, EOS, ADA, CROEso establece un ciclo propicio para los inversores de riesgo, que ven el staking de, Andreessen-Horowitz, de 40 millones de dólares llegó a una valoración de 2.5 mil millones de dólares. ""Entonces, lo que esto va a hacer, es atraer atención al espacio, traer más activos al espacio DeFi"", agregó.Guerras de agricultura de rendimientoEl exchange descentralizado (DEX), Balancer, ya lanzó un esquema de incentivos similar y vio como su valoración llego hasta las nubes. Según se informa, su esquema de incentivos fue planeado por el exchange, FTX, y el proyecto promulgó informalmente un cambio para reducir esto.Pero a pesar de este problema, Anderson cree que muchos proyectos implementaran esta estrategia:""Apuesto a que este planteamiento que esta utilizando el token sera algo que estimule una APR alta para impulsar más activos dentro de plataforma, esto será lo que veremos durante los próximos seis, nueve y doce meses"".La sostenibilidad en la agricultura de rendimiento de COMP depende completamente del precio del token, que ""tiene un largo camino por recorrer (hacia abajo)"" antes de que las tasas de interés vuelvan a los valores promedio. Al mismo tiempo, la competencia de incentivos similares por plataformas como, Balancer, ""podría ser algo que aleje a los activos de COMP"".Hyundai agrega otra pieza a su creciente ecosistema blockchainKava, un proyecto DeFi, donde el CEO de Compound, Robert Leshner, y Framework son inversores, parece estar preparado para implementar sistemas parecidos. En una conversación con Cointelegraph, el ingeniero principal, Kevin Davis, dijo que si bien pueden evitar una participación excesiva, es algo difícil, ""algunos factores conducirán a un enfriamiento en este ciclo de mercado, y el comportamiento alocado de los precios de COMP no es algo representado por la tendencia de la agricultura de rendimiento"".La incertidumbre sobre el éxito permaneceSi bien los incentivos de recompensa lograron atraer a muchos usuarios a corto plazo, Davis no está seguro que muchos de ellos estarán realmente interesados en el aspecto de la gobernabilidad. También se desconoce cuántos de ellos seguirán siendo usuarios de Compound a largo plazo, algo que, en opinión de Davis, es uno de los principales objetivos de la iniciativa.Bitfinex lanza un protocolo de transmisión de datos de código abierto basado en el intercambio P2P de criptomonedasSi bien cree que también es un ejemplo válido para descentralizar progresivamente una plataforma, aún es demasiado pronto para llamarlo de manera concluyente como un rotundo éxito:""Todavía queda por ver cuánta descentralización se logra, o si el protocolo Compound (o el token COMP) tiene el ajuste del mercado de productos en su forma actual"".Sigue leyendo:Joaquin Morinigo: “Bitcoin es básicamente el oro de mi generación, de la Generación Z”Análisis de precios al 26/06: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, BSV, LTC, BNB, EOS, ADA, CROHyundai agrega otra pieza a su creciente ecosistema blockchainBitfinex lanza un protocolo de transmisión de datos de código abierto basado en el intercambio P2P de criptomonedas5 proyectos DeFi doblaron el precio de sus tokens en Mayo alineándose con el nuevo orden financieroBitso busca atraer clientes regalando 5 DAI por cada 100 que se depositenAVA se integra a oráculos de precios y datos en el mercado Chainlink",https://blockboard.net/es/el-token-comp-construye-el-camino-hacia-las-guerras-de-agricultura-de-rendimiento/,0.0,-0.6808

Si bien aún podemos considerarlos pequeños experimentos, la tecnología que existe detrás de estas monedas digitales descentralizadas está diseñada para continuar creciendo por generaciones, adaptándose a nuevos entornos, transformado la forma en la que resguardamos y transmitimos valor.Por primera vez en la historia, tenemos dinero programable, resistente a la censura, descentralizado, P2P, global, inconfiscable y no dependiente de la política monetaria de ningún país. Si bien un Bitcoin es igual a un Bitcoin en cualquier país, cada país tendrá una relación distinta con esta tecnología. Los casos de uso son gigantescos y aún estamos descubriendo el verdadero potencial de estas tecnologías en contextos reales y prácticos. En este sentido, estas tecnologías suponen alternativas monetarias y protocolos de desarrollo que pueden ser utilizados libremente. Al ser tecnologías de código abierto, las probabilidades de que continúen creciendo de forma orgánica es inevitable.Estas características me hacen pensar que las criptomonedas son imparables y que continuaremos viendo el crecimiento del ecosistema y más casos de uso que llevarán a más personas a utilizar criptomonedas como parte esencial de su economía. Creo que la adopción masiva de estas tecnologías es inevitable e impactará de forma significativa las formas en las que concebimos el dinero, la forma en la que lo resguardamos y lo transferimos.Introducción a Decred: una reserva de valor con seguridad, adaptabilidad y sustentabilidadFQ: ¿Consideras que las criptomonedas son un cambio de paradigma en las finanzas?EH: ¡Absolutamente! Y es algo que analizaría desde dos perspectivas. Primero desde lo individual, las criptomonedas pueden dar soberanía total al individuo sobre su riqueza. Por primera vez en la historia las personas tienen una alternativa que les permite tener el control absoluto de su dinero. Particularmente, en contextos de totalitarismo, esto supone una herramienta para la libertad y seguridad personal de millones de personas. Son significativos los contextos en donde el dinero ha dejado de funcionar o se ha convertido en una herramienta para la represión. Es en estos casos en donde las criptomonedas son un seguro en contra de la tiranía monetaria y son efectivamente una herramienta de seguridad financiera. Desde el punto de vista global, las criptomonedas son la infraestructura base para una diversidad de nuevas ideas y aplicaciones. En un primer momento pensaba que las criptomonedas se adaptarían al sistema financiera tradicional. Ahora pienso que el sistema financiero tradicional será el que se adapte a la cimentación económica que se está creando sobre estos protocolos. Creo que el cambio de paradigma se dará en la diversidad de alternativas monetarias que existirán. Veremos monedas digitales de bancos centrales (CBDC por sus siglas en inglés), monedas digitales corporativas (Libra y lo que vengan después) y monedas digitales descentralizadas (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Decred, etc). La naturaleza abierta de estos protocolos significa una ventaja exponencial en comparación de los sistemas financieros tradicionales que podría traducirse en adopción exponencial a escala global.Decred: desarrollo durante el bear marketFQ:¿En qué países de Latinoamérica notas más interés por las criptomonedas?EH: Considero que Argentina, Brasil, México y Venezuela son los países con mayor interés, volumen, adopción y desarrollo de Latinoamérica. Argentina es un ejemplo de lo que sucede cuando el dinero deja de funcionar. Los argentinos son un ejemplo de emprendimiento y las criptomonedas una plataforma de desarrollo sobre la cual hay una generación entera innovando y buscando alternativas a un sistema económico que está roto. Brasil tiene los mayores volúmenes de intercambio en la región, una comunidad vibrante de emprendedores y la mayor cantidad de usuarios del continente. México tiene un ambiente regulatorio positivo, cerca de un millón de usuarios de criptomonedas y uno de los mercados de remesas más grandes del mundo. Venezuela ha visto el dinero dejar de funcionar, los venezolanos han buscando alternativas a esta situación. Junto con la Argentina, es la sociedad más avanzada en términos de reconocimiento y uso de estas tecnologías.FQ ¿Crees que hace falta más educación financiera en la población en general?EH: Sin duda. En términos generales no hay una buena educación financiera en la región, no sabemos ahorrar y mucho menos sabemos invertir. En el caso de las criptomonedas, es fundamental invertir tiempo en educación. Pienso que las personas que han comenzado a utilizar criptomonedas pueden mejorar su educación financiera al cuestionar las nociones básicas de qué es y cómo funciona el dinero.FQ ¿Cómo está funcionando Decred en Latinoamérica? ¿En qué países de LATAM hay más movimiento de este ecosistema?EH: Los últimos dos años han sido un camino largo en el desarrollo del ecosistema Decred en LATAM. Cuando comenzamos no existía nada sobre el proyecto en la región y en español. Desde entonces hemos organizado y participado en eventos en México, Panamá, Colombia, Venezuela, Perú, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina y Uruguay. Nos damos cuenta que existe un gran interés por conocer más sobre nuestro blockchain híbrido PoW/PoS, Politeia como mecanismo de gobernanza, la Tesorería y la posibilidad de presentar propuestas a la comunidad de Decred.Para el equipo de Decred en Español es fundamental continuar construyendo puentes con las diversas comunidades en LATAM y aportar contenido de calidad que nos lleve como industria a tener usuarios más críticos del ecosistema. Es por esto que estamos desarrollando contenido sobre diversas temáticas como desarrollo de software de código abierto, prevención de estafas, análisis de mercados, aplicaciones sobre Lightning Network, privacidad, educación sobre exchanges descentralizados y otros temas que consideramos importantes para la comunidad.Decred Latam presenta propuesta de marketing en la plataforma de gobernanza PoliteiaFQ: ¿Y cuál es la situación de Decred en España?EH: España tiene la particularidad de contar con sistemas bancarios y financieros sólidos. Pienso que el interés de la comunidad española gira en torno al desarrollo de productos y servicios que se apalanquen de la tecnología que las criptomonedas ofrecen. En este sentido, es importante para Decred en Español conectar con emprendedores que estén buscando tecnología para sus desarrollos. Es por esto que ha sido prioritario establecer conexiones con la comunidad de criptomonedas española.FQ:¿En qué se diferencia Decred de otras criptomonedas? ¿Qué características son únicas?EH: Decred tiene varias características que lo diferencian fundamentalmente del resto de las criptomonedas:- Es un blockchain híbrido PoW/PoS para asegurar la red de forma exponencial- Una Tesorería que recibe el 10% de las recompensas de los bloques y nos permite pagar por el desarrollo continuo del proyecto- Politeia como mecanismo de gobernanza para presentar y votar propuestas para la comunidad de stakeholders- Integración a Lightning Network y lanzamiento próximo de nuestro exchange descentralizado para incrementar la soberanía de nuestros usuarios- Privacidad, próximamente en nuestra cartera digital Decrediton- Una fuerza de trabajo global con más de 70 contratistas de 35 países trabajando en desarrollo, estrategia, diseño, comunicación y comunidad. En resumen Decred está diseñado para existir por generaciones al ser seguro, adaptable y autosustentable.FQ: ¿Cómo describirías a la comunidad de Decred?EH: Decred es una comunidad vibrante que no para de desarrollar herramientas libres para la sociedad. Creemos firmemente en la necesidad de que nuestra tecnología tenga un impacto positivo en la soberanía de milliones de personas en el mundo. Te puede interesar:Introducción a Decred: una reserva de valor con seguridad, adaptabilidad y sustentabilidadDecred: desarrollo durante el bear marketDecred Latam presenta propuesta de marketing en la plataforma de gobernanza PoliteiaInforme de CGC: Mexicanos, argentinos y brasileños son los más dispuestos a tener criptomonedas Análisis de precios, 04 de junio: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar, IOTA  (2018)Registraron la marca y el logotipo de Bitcoin en la Oficina Española de Patentes y MarcasUphold lanza oficialmente un nuevo servicio que permite la adquisición de acciones estadounidenses desde Latinoamérica",https://blockboard.net/es/elian-huesca-btc-eth-y-decred-son-parte-de-la-mayor-revolucion-tecnologica-y-economica-de-nuestra-generacion/,0.0,-0.7393

Así lo informaron a Cointelegraph en Español, a través de un comunicado.Smart Trust, que está en fase de prueba desde enero de 2020, tiene la particularidad de ser una plataforma pensada y desarrollada por la industria trust management para ese ámbito. Según informaron, entre otras cosas, cuenta con el valor agregado de otorgarle acceso 24/7 a los clientes de las firmas de trust y family offices al mismo tiempo que permite generar ingresos adicionales a quienes administran trusts y lograr ahorros vinculados con una mayor eficiencia en sus operaciones.Un equipo fintech en Buenos Aires desarrolló la plataforma blockchain Smart Trust Litwak y Ravinovich, creadores de la idea inicial, señalaron:“Nos valemos de los beneficios de la tecnología blockchain para otorgar ventajas únicas y solucionar problemas hasta ahora no resueltos en la industria, como contar con un Time Stamp de cuándo y quién realizó cada una de las transacciones u operaciones dentro cada estructura fiduciaria. Por otro lado, la inmutabilidad que suma esta tecnología, otorga un valor agregado único y suma aún mayor credibilidad a un negocio que se basa principalmente en la confianza”.Cabe tener en cuenta que este primer producto se encuentra en la etapa de trial partners, lo cual implica que hay varias compañías fiduciarias y entidades financieras que están utilizando la plataforma y brindando valioso feedback.Fundador de Singulogic: ""Blockchain servirá para combatir la desigualdad y corrupción de la región"" “La plataforma ha sido mostrada a varias otras compañías fiduciarias que han expresado su interés en convertirse en clientes una vez que comience la venta al público y han, por otro lado, validado el potencial de Smart Trust. Dichos clientes potenciales se encuentran mayormente en el Caribe y también en los EE.UU, aunque el producto tiene alcance global”, especificaron en el comunicado.“Debido a la arquitectura y las particularidades de cómo fue construido Smart Trust, el producto posee una alta posibilidad de escalabilidad. Escalabilidad y versatilidad que está presente en los futuros verticales que Smart Structuring tiene planificado”, añadieron.En el webinario del día jueves, se brindarán más detalles del producto, del equipo y se lanzará oficialmente una nueva ronda de capitalización.

Allaire señaló que la idea es obviamente atractiva porque “los casos de uso son tan amplios, que en última instancia, son como los casos de uso por dinero. Entonces, ¿Qué podrías hacer con un dólar? Eso es digital”.Hessert también señaló que los dólares fiduciarios son un área privilegiada para acelerar las transacciones globales, dado a su uso masivo internacional, señalando que: “Hoy, los dólares son realmente críticos para permitir que esto suceda.
