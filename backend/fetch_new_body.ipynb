      "Discover Thomson ReutersBy Reuters Staff2 Min ReadBEIJING (Reuters) -Tesla Inc said on Friday it has started selling China-made Model Y sport-utility vehicles (SUV) and will deliver them to customers this month, as the U.S. electric vehicle maker expands sales in the world’s biggest car market.China, which offers hefty subsidies for electric vehicles as it seeks to cut down on pollution from petrol or diesel cars, is key to Tesla’s global strategy. It is expanding its Shanghai car factory, where it also builds its Model 3 sedans. In October, it started exporting Model 3 vehicles to Europe.It is also adding manufacturing capacity for EV chargers in Shanghai and expanding its sales and service network around the country. It sold over 20,000 vehicles in November.The starting price of a Model Y in China is now 339,900 yuan ($52,091.95), according to its China website.Tesla’s rivals in China include Volkswagen AG, BMW as well as local startups such as Nio Inc, Xpeng Inc, and Li Auto Inc, which all have electric SUV models.

      "The European market continues to see strong adoption of battery powered electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.What Happened: Through the first 11 months of 2020, Europeans have registered 1,085,000 new electric vehicles, according to EV Sales Blog and InsideEVs.The 11-month totals are up 198% year-over-year and represent 10% of all new vehicle sales in Europe.In November, 166,255 new electric vehicles were sold. The total represents 16% market share for new cars in Europe, split evenly between battery powered (8%) and plug-in hybrids (8%).Battery-powered vehicle sales were up 182% year-over-year. Plug-in hybrid sales were up 217% year-over-year. The large increase came as the overall car market saw a 14% year-over-year decline in sales.Related Link: Xpeng Takes On Tesla, Volkswagen In Norway: What Investors Should KnowThe Winners: The top-selling electric vehicle in Europe for November was the Renault ZOE with 9,953 units sold. The vehicle also ranks first on the year with 83,000 units sold and has 8% market share.The Volkswagen ID.3 was the second bestselling model in November with 8,496 units sold. The vehicle ranks sixth on the year. InsideEVs sees the car finishing third or fourth on the year with a close head-to-head battle coming for the December crown.The Tesla Model 3 from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) was the fourth bestselling electric vehicle in Europe with 5,014 units sold in November. The vehicle ranks second year-to-date with 63,000 units sold and a 6% overall market share.December is often the best month for new car sales. InsideEVs sees the month shaping up as a battle between the Tesla Model 3 and the VW ID.3. December could also be a record for electric vehicles, with the possibility of 20% market share.Electric vehicles made up 3.6% of all car sales in Europe in 2019. Photo courtesy of Tesla. © 2021 Benzinga.com.

      "In this articleTech's biggest companies just wrapped up a huge year.The seven most valuable U.S. technology companies — Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Tesla and Nvidia — picked up a combined $3.4 trillion in market cap in 2020, powering through a global pandemic and broader economic crisis.Between continued optimism over iPhone sales, Microsoft's growing Teams collaboration product, Amazon's ongoing control of e-commerce and the strength of Google and Facebook's online ad duopoly, Big Tech was neither slowed by Covid-19 nor the rising number of investigations into its dominance.Tesla's wild rally served as the biggest surprise. The stock climbed almost ninefold this year, lifting the electric car maker's market cap from $76 billion at the beginning of the year to $669 billion at Thursday's close. Despite initial factory closures due to the pandemic, Tesla bounced back to deliver a record number of vehicles in the third quarter.This month, Tesla became the largest-ever addition to the S&amp;P 500, joining the index with the fifth-heftiest weighting after turning in five straight profitable quarters.Meanwhile, chipmaker Nvidia more than doubled in value in 2020, closing with a market cap of $323 billion, making it the seventh most valuable tech company and number 16 overall in the U.S. Nvidia's graphics processors for gaming devices have been flying off the shelves so quickly that the company has struggled to keep up with demand.Nvidia's chips are also gaining traction in the data center, where enhanced workloads require faster speeds. In September, Nvidia agreed to buy mobile chipmaker Arm Holdings from SoftBank for $40 billion, the second-largest deal announced by a U.S. tech company this year. However, Chinese regulators could still block it.By far the biggest increase in market cap went to Apple, which jumped by almost $1 trillion in value, thanks to its stock climbing 81%. Amazon, which benefited from growth in its consumer and cloud-computing business, rose by $710 billion. Microsoft picked up $480 billion, while Alphabet gained $268 billion and Facebook $193 billion.The gains are clearly reflected in the ranks of the richest people. Amazon's Jeff Bezos is the wealthiest person in the world, followed by Tesla's Elon Musk and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is fifth. Also in the top 10 are Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Microsoft ex-CEO Steve Ballmer.WATCH: Big tech has done well with or without economic stimulusGot a confidential news tip?

      "Returns as of 7/14/2021Returns as of 7/14/2021Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.The Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) has been an exciting place for investors in 2020, and so it's reasonable that the high-flying index would take a break to finish a historic year. As of 2:45 p.m. EST, the Nasdaq Composite was down just a tiny fraction of a percentage point, having regained much of its losses from earlier in the session.It shouldn't come as a big shock that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is finishing 2020 on a positive note. With a push to all-time record highs, the electric automaker became part of the S&amp;P 500 index and has joined the mainstream of the investing world. Meanwhile, another stock from the Nasdaq's ranks will follow in Tesla's footsteps soon, as Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) got a vote of confidence from index managers.It's hard to overstate the influence that Tesla has had on the Nasdaq and the broader market in 2020. The stock added another 2% on Thursday afternoon, climbing above the $700-per-share mark for the very first time.Image source: Tesla.The big question that investors always have for Tesla as the end of the year approaches is whether the electric vehicle pioneer will be able to get as many cars delivered to customers as it projected. The typical Tesla end-of-quarter push is in full swing, with the usual messages being sent from CEO Elon Musk to employees urging them to take every possible step to maximize vehicle deliveries to make the quarterly and yearly targets.Tesla's 500,000 vehicle goal was ambitious even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, and that complicated things even further. However, even with the challenges in front of it, the company might well end up above that number once the final tallies are in.Regardless, the longer-term story for Tesla involves pent-up demand and continuing rising interest in its vehicles, as well as the other technologies that it has developed. If it can keep up its momentum, Tesla could have a lot of growth ahead of it, and high-priced shares give the automaker stock some capital-raising options that its rivals can only wish they had.Shares of Enphase Energy were also on the rise, climbing 2%. That was short of an all-time record, but the solar panel microinverter specialist got some good news from the folks at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.Enphase will join the S&amp;P 500 index effective Jan. 7, moving up from the S&amp;P MidCap 400 index. A spot opened up in the S&amp;P 500 with the expected purchase of high-end jewelry icon Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. After that sale is complete, Tiffany shares will no longer trade, and that put S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices in a position in which it had to find a replacement.Unlike Tesla, Enphase's addition shouldn't create a huge disruption for index fund investors in mutual funds and ETFs that track the S&amp;P 500. Enphase's market capitalization is just $22 billion even after the run-up today, and that means that only a small fraction of a percent of index fund assets will have to go toward purchasing Enphase shares. The move will likely still have some impact on share prices, but it won't grab the same amount of attention that Tesla's addition did.Joining the S&amp;P 500 is a big moment for Enphase, but the company's long-term future relies on ongoing demand for solar energy installations. There's still plenty of room for growth in that arena, and Enphase's first-mover advantage in microinverters gives it an edge that it'll carry into 2021 and beyond.Discounted offers are only available to new members.

      "By Daniel Perrone, Director and Head of Operations, ESG Indices, S&amp;P Dow Jones IndicesSince S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices announced that Tesla would be added to the S&amp;P 500® on Dec. 21, 2020, many investors have contacted us asking when this transformative company will become a member of the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index, the sustainable counterpart to the S&amp;P 500. The answer, in brief, is that Tesla will not automatically join the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index upon its addition to the S&amp;P 500. Instead, Tesla will be assessed during the next annual rebalance of the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index, taking place at the end of April 2021. But even then, inclusion into the index is not assured. Whether Tesla becomes an index constituent will be determined by its sustainability performance across many criteria relative to its peers.The main driver of whether a company is selected to join the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index is its S&amp;P DJI ESG Score. This score is derived from the annual Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA), which is administered by SAM, a part of S&amp;P Global. The CSA is a highly granular, industry-specific questionnaire based on financial material ESG metrics. Insights gathered from the CSA form the backbone of the ESG score that is used to select companies added to the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index.For this current assessment year, Tesla’s S&amp;P DJI ESG Score was 22 out of 100, up 8 points from 2019’s score. This is driven by its ESG Dimension Scores, including an Environmental score of 28 (up 1 point from last year), a Social score of 6 (up 2 points), and a Governance score of 49 (up 21 points). Tesla does not fill out the CSA, so its S&amp;P DJI ESG Score is determined based on research using publicly available information.Many may be surprised to see such a low overall ESG score (and Environmental score) for Tesla, given its focus on electric vehicles. Specializing in “green” products, however, does not automatically ensure that companies will score well from an overall ESG perspective. The S&amp;P DJI ESG Score is wide ranging in what it encompasses, as it is meant to capture a company’s broad sustainability performance.In the Environmental dimension, Tesla of course scored well in the area of low carbon strategy, with a nearly perfect score of 99. However, the company scored low in environmental reporting, climate strategy, and environmental policy and management systems, which suppressed the company’s overall Environmental score.[1] Tesla also scored especially low on social metrics across the board, which include human capital development, social reporting, and labor practice indicators. Tesla did comparatively well in the Governance realm, especially relative to the prior year.[2]So, what does this mean for Tesla’s standing in the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index? We won’t know until the upcoming annual rebalance is finalized on the last business day of April 2021. At that time, Tesla will be measured against its peers across many ESG criteria. As mentioned earlier, however, the biggest determinant of the composition of the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index is a company’s S&amp;P DJI ESG Score. But it’s not just a company’s absolute performance that matters; a company also needs to rate well relative to its peers.The S&amp;P DJI ESG Score is used in two ways in the index methodology. First, the bottom 25% of companies in each GICS® industry group is screened out on a global basis. This prevents a company that is a good ESG performer locally but poor on a global basis from making it into the index. Second, companies are ranked by their ESG score within the S&amp;P 500 and then selected from the top down to get as close as possible to 75% of the industry group’s original market capitalization.Will Tesla make it through these two key screens and become a member of the S&amp;P 500 ESG Index? Next April, we’ll know. The S&amp;P 500 ESG Index has no early-entry rule that would afford Tesla extra privileges; it will be treated the same as any other company.The author would like to thank Reid Steadman for his extensive contributions to this blog post.Originally published by Indexology, 12/22/201 According to the CSA, low carbon strategy (which is a unique criterion to the automobiles industry) is defined as an assessment of strategies implemented by companies to reduce the carbon intensity of their core portfolio, while climate strategy is defined as an assessment of strategies put in place by companies to address the scale of the challenge climate change represents for their industry, and environmental policy and management systems covers management tools implemented by companies in order to improve their environmental performance in a cost-effective way and reduce the risk of incurring fines or penalties for not complying with environmental legislation.2 To provide some context for Tesla’s scores, the S&amp;P DJI ESG Scores are normalized across global industries and are designed to be read as percentiles. Thus, a score of 22 means that that company had a higher score than 22% of its industry peers globally.The posts on this blog are opinions, not advice. Please read our Disclaimers.
