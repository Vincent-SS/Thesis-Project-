It threatens to kill the company, which invites retaliation from Beijing.In May, the administration of President Donald Trump mandated that\u00a0manufacturers globally couldn\u2019t use American technology to produce chips designed by Huawei.At first, that also threatened chief supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., until it became clear that a legal workaround was available: Let Huawei buy chips that it didn\u2019t design. As a result, Taiwan\u2019s MediaTek Inc. stepped into the breach and quickly became the biggest purveyor of\u00a0key 5G smartphone components, which are made by TSMC.It looked like a kind of win-win for everyone. Washington could curb Huawei\u2019s semiconductor development, and by extension Beijing\u2019s ambitions;\u00a0Taiwan,\u00a0a\u00a0key U.S. ally, got a revenue boost; and Huawei itself would still survive even if its technology was hobbled.But that wan\u2019t enough for the Trump administration.On Monday the Commerce Department expanded\u00a0its foreign-produced direct product rule to include situations \u201cwhere U.S. software or technology is the basis for a foreign-produced item\u201d that will be\u00a0used by Huawei, or where the company\u00a0is party to such a transaction, such as being an intermediary supplier.This is Trump launching a nuclear warhead aimed directly at Huawei.\u00a0Secretary of State Mike Pompeo basically acknowledges as much.\u00a0There are\u00a0dozens of steps in developing, manufacturing and installing chips in a device, with U.S. technology an integral part throughout. Synopsys Inc. and Cadence Design Systems Inc. make software used to design semiconductors;\u00a0Lam Research Corp. and Applied Materials Inc. are major suppliers of manufacturing equipment \u2014\u00a0all four companies are based in Silicon Valley.There are\u00a0many more American technology providers crucial to the process. Remove just one, and any chip company will struggle to keep up. Removing them all would be akin to cutting off the oxygen. And if the new rule is to be strictly interpreted, then even the use of generalist technologies like PCs running on Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Windows and Intel Corp. processors could be prohibited.Huawei might, just might, be able to cobble together a patchwork of suppliers that not only are non-American but don\u2019t even use U.S.\u00a0technology. But this backup solution would\u00a0be far inferior to that available to global peers, and any effort would be full of\u00a0landmines \u2014\u00a0even if Huawei doesn\u2019t care about upsetting the U.S. (that horse has bolted), every single non-American company it deals with, even Chinese, will be rightfully paranoid about putting a foot wrong.More importantly, such an alternative supply chain will take time, which China doesn\u2019t have. Despite billions of dollars in spending and investment, the nation still significantly lags behind the U.S. in semiconductor technology. This is a fast-moving industry where even the best can struggle,\u00a0as Intel Corp. has found.Spending a\u00a0year reconfiguring\u00a0Huawei\u2019s design and development process would widen that gap, keeping in mind that the world\u2019s leaders \u2014\u00a0such as Qualcomm Inc., Apple Inc., TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co. \u2014 continue to move forward, and do so thanks to\u00a0a globally integrated industry.I predicted a while ago that the technology sector would become bifurcated. Companies, and countries, will be forced to choose which side of the aisle they\u2019re on. Both Beijing and Washington are to blame for this \u2014\u00a0the Great Firewall was built well before Trump came on the scene.\u00a0As the underdog,\u00a0China\u00a0has no choice but to soldier on, and\u00a0Huawei is both the symbol and the incarnation of this great battle.\u201cI don\u2019t think the Chinese government will just watch and let Huawei be slaughtered on a chopping board,\u201d its\u00a0rotating chairman\u00a0Eric Xu said\u00a0in March.\u00a0\u201cI believe the Chinese government will also take some countermeasures.\u201dJust because there\u2019s a missile heading toward Huawei doesn\u2019t mean it will land. The U.S. left open the option for licensing access, there\u2019s still a trade deal to hammer out, and a presidential election in November\u00a0could see a change of administration.Yet the threat is real and Beijing has no technology with which to fight back. That means we\u2019re into asymmetric warfare. China might not have chips, but it has much of the supply chain within its borders and the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Oh, and it also holds $1.1 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities\u00a0and $3 trillion in forex reserves.We shouldn\u2019t expect a clean fight.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

This increase was primarily the result of net proceeds of $1.97 billion on issuance of long-term debt and $813.0 million of cash generated from operating activities. These sources of cash were partially offset by the $1.25 billion repayment of borrowings from the Company's revolving credit facility and $167.7 million of dividends paid to stockholders.RevenueThe geographic distribution of revenue during the June 2020 quarter is shown in the following table:RegionRevenue  China34%  Korea32%  Taiwan11%  Japan8%  United States7%  Southeast Asia5%  Europe3%    The following table presents revenue disaggregated between system and customer support-related revenue:\u00a0Three Months Ended\u00a0Twelve Months Ended  \u00a0June\u00a028,   2020\u00a0March 29,\u00a0  2020\u00a0June\u00a030,   2019\u00a0June\u00a028,   2020\u00a0June\u00a030,   2019  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0(In thousands)  Systems revenue$1,865,249\u00a0$1,647,560\u00a0$1,570,373\u00a0$6,625,130\u00a0$6,451,104  Customer support-related revenue and other926,615\u00a0856,065\u00a0790,774\u00a03,419,606\u00a03,202,455  \u00a0$2,791,864\u00a0$2,503,625\u00a0$2,361,147\u00a0$10,044,736\u00a0$9,653,559    System revenue includes sales of new leading-edge equipment in deposition, etch and clean markets.Customer support-related revenue includes sales of customer service, spares, upgrades, and non-leading-edge equipment from our Reliant product line.OutlookFor the quarter ended September 27, 2020, Lam is providing the following guidance:\u00a0U.S. GAAP\u00a0Reconciling   Items\u00a0Non-GAAP  Revenue$3.1 Billion+/-$200 Million\u00a0\u2014\u00a0$3.1 Billion+/-$200 Million  Gross margin as a percentage of revenue46.4%+/-1%\u00a0$2\u00a0Million\u00a046.5%+/-1%  Operating income as a percentage of revenue29.0%+/-1%\u00a0$14 Million\u00a029.5%+/-1%  Net income per diluted share$5.06+/-$0.40\u00a0$13 Million\u00a0$5.15+/-$0.40  Diluted share count147 Million\u00a0\u2014\u00a0147 Million    The information provided above is only an estimate of what the Company believes is realizable as of the date of this release and does not incorporate the potential impact of any business combinations, asset acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring, balance sheet valuation adjustments, financing arrangements, other investments, or other significant arrangements that may be completed after the date of this release. U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items provided include only those items that are known and can be estimated as of the date of this release. Actual results will vary from this model and the variations may be material. Reconciling items included above are as follows:  * Gross margin as a percentage of revenue - amortization related to intangible assets acquired through business combinations, $2 million.      * Operating income as a percentage of revenue - amortization related to intangible assets acquired through business combinations, $14 million.      * Net income per diluted share - amortization related to intangible assets acquired though business combinations, $14 million; amortization of note discounts, $1 million; and associated tax benefit for non-GAAP items ($2 million); totaling $13 million.Use of Non-GAAP Financial ResultsIn addition to U.S. GAAP results, this press release also contains non-GAAP financial results. The Company\u2019s non-GAAP results for both the June 2020 and March 2020 quarters exclude amortization related to intangible assets acquired through business combinations, the effects of elective deferred compensation-related assets and liabilities, amortization of note discounts, and income tax expense (benefit) of non-GAAP items. Additionally, the June 2020 quarter non-GAAP results exclude an adjustment to the previously recognized cumulative income tax benefit reversal associated with the Ninth Circuit decision to deny a rehearing of the Altera stock-based compensation case and the March 2020 quarter non-GAAP results exclude the income tax benefit on conclusion of certain tax matters related to a prior business combination.Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, operating expense, operating income, operating income as a percentage of revenue, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company\u2019s operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors\u2019 ability to view the Company\u2019s results from management\u2019s perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company\u2019s website at http://investor.lamresearch.com.Caution Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsStatements made in this press release that are not of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
