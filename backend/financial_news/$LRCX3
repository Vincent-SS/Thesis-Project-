The unfolding skirmish is starting to make companies nervous the trading landscape could shift out from under them.\u201cThere are many industries where U.S. companies have made long-term bets on China\u2019s future because the market is so promising and so big,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s head of international affairs. Now, they\u2019re \u201crecognizing the risk.\u201dChina will look to avoid measures that could backfire, said Shi Yinhong, an adviser to the nation\u2019s cabinet and a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. Any sanctions on U.S. companies would be a \u201clast resort\u201d because China \u201cis in desperate need of foreign investment from rich countries for both economic and political reasons.\u201dNevertheless, pressure is only expected to intensify ahead of the U.S. elections in November, as President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden joust over who will take a tougher line on China.Trump has blamed China for covering up the coronavirus pandemic he has mocked as \u201cKung Flu,\u201d accused Beijing of \u201cillicit espionage to steal our industrial secrets\u201d and threatened the U.S. could pursue a \u201ccomplete decoupling\u201d from the country. Biden, likewise, has described President Xi Jinping as a thug, labeled mass detention of Uighur Muslims as unconscionable and accused China of predatory trade practices.And on Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats have found rare unity in their opposition to China, with lawmakers eager to take action against Beijing for its handling of Covid-19, forced technology transfers, human rights abuses and its tightening grip on Hong Kong.\u201cChina is going to be a punching bag in the campaign,\u201d said Capital Alpha Partners\u2019 Byron Callan. \u201cBut China is a punching bag that can punch back.\u201dChina has repeatedly rejected U.S. accusations over its handling of the pandemic, Uighurs, Hong Kong and trade, and it has fired back at the Trump administration for undermining global cooperation and seeking to start a \u201cnew cold war.\u201d Foreign Minister Wang Yi last month said China had no interest in replacing the U.S. as a hegemonic power, while adding that the U.S. should give up its \u201cwishful thinking\u201d of changing the country.Both sides have already taken a series of regulatory moves aimed at protecting market share.The U.S. is citing security concerns in blocking China Mobile Ltd., the world\u2019s largest mobile operator, from entering the U.S. market. It\u2019s culling Chinese-made drones from government fleets and discouraging the deployment of Chinese transformers on the power grid. The Trump administration has also tried to constrain the global reach of China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co., the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer.Meanwhile, China prevented U.S. airline flights into the country for more than two months and, after the U.S. imposed visa restrictions on Chinese journalists, it expelled American journalists. It has stepped up its scrutiny of U.S. companies, with China\u2019s state news agency casting one probe as a warning to the White House. China also has long made it difficult for U.S. telecommunications companies to enter its market, requiring overseas operators to co-invest with local firms and requiring authorization by the central government.One of the most combustible flash points has been the Trump administration\u2019s campaign to contain Huawei by seeking to limit the company\u2019s business in the U.S. and push allies to shun its gear in their networks.The U.S. Federal Communications Commission moved to block devices made by Huawei and ZTE Corp. from being used in U.S. networks. And the Commerce Department has placed Huawei on blacklists aimed at preventing the Chinese company from using U.S. technology for the chips that power its network gear, including tech from suppliers Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Inc.After suppliers found work-arounds, Commerce in May tightened rules to bar any chipmaker using American equipment from selling to Huawei without U.S. approval. The step could constrain virtually the entire contract chipmaking industry, which uses equipment from U.S. vendors such as Applied Materials Inc., Lam Research Corp. and KLA Corp. in wafer fabrication plants.The curbs also threaten to cripple Huawei. Although the company can buy off-the-shelf or commodity mobile chips from a third party such as Samsung Electronics Co. or MediaTek Inc., going that route would force it to make costly compromises on performance in basic products.Huawei was on a list the Pentagon unveiled last week of companies it says are owned or controlled by China\u2019s military, opening them to increased scrutiny. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing accused the Trump administration of \u201cviolating the very market economy principle the U.S. champions.\u201d\u201cWe are strongly opposed to this,\u201d the foreign ministry said Sunday of the Pentagon\u2019s designation. \u201cChina urges the U.S. to stop suppressing Chinese companies without reason and provide a fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese companies to operate normally in the U.S.\u201dAfter the new restrictions, the editor of the Communist Party\u2019s Global Times newspaper tweeted that China would retaliate using an \u201cunreliable entities list\u201d that it first threatened at the height of the trade war last year. Although China didn\u2019t identify companies on the list, the Global Times has cited a source close to the Chinese government as saying U.S. bellwethers such as Apple Inc. and Qualcomm could be targeted.The fallout could extend to companies heavily reliant on Chinese supply chains, as well consumer-facing brands eager to expand sales in Asia. Boeing Co., which recorded $5.7 billion of revenue from China in 2019, and Tesla Inc., the biggest U.S. carmaker operating independently in China, are among companies most exposed if relations sour further.\u201cWe\u2019re playing in a much wider field now,\u201d said Jim Lucier, managing director of research firm Capital Alpha Partners. \u201cWe\u2019re not simply talking about \u2018you tariff me\u2019 and \u2018I tariff you.\u2019 The playing field is virtually unlimited.\u201dPlanes and AutomobilesU.S. automakers have also been singed. In June, China fined Ford Motor Co.\u2019s main joint venture in the country for antitrust violations, saying Changan Ford Automobile Co. had restricted retailers\u2019 sale prices since 2013.Aviation has been another source of tension, as both countries squabble over access to their skies. China\u2019s decision to limit U.S. airlines operations to those services scheduled as of March 12 hurt carriers such as United Airlines Holdings Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc, and American Airlines Group Inc. that had suspended passenger flights to and from China because of the coronavirus pandemic.The U.S. responded earlier this month by initially threatening to ban all flights from China, then relenting to allow two flights weekly once Chinese officials eased their restrictions. Now, in what appears to be a staged de-escalation, China gave U.S. passenger carriers permission to operate four weekly flights to the country and earlier this month, the Trump administration matched the move by also authorizing four flights from Chinese airlines.It\u2019s happening outside of aviation too. Consider the U.S. government\u2019s decision to seize a half-ton, Chinese-made electrical transformer when it arrived at an American port last year and divert the gear to a national lab instead of the Colorado substation where it was supposed to be deployed. That move -- and a May executive order from Trump authorizing the blockade of electric grid gear supplied by \u201cforeign adversaries\u201d of the U.S. in the name of national security -- have already sent shock waves through the power sector.The effect has been to dissuade American utilities from buying Chinese equipment to replace aging components in the nation\u2019s electrical grid, said Jim Cai, the U.S. representative for Jiangsu Huapeng Transformer Co., the company whose delivery was seized. Although Cai said the firm has supplied parts to private utilities and government-run grid operators in the U.S. for nearly 15 years without security complaints, at least one American utility has since canceled a transformer award to the company, Cai said.Trump\u2019s directive is tied to a broader effort to bring more manufacturing to the U.S. from China. \u201cThis is a part of the administration\u2019s efforts to impair China\u2019s supply chains into the United States,\u201d said former White House adviser Mike McKenna.Escalating tensions could jeopardize the U.S. economic recovery as well as China\u2019s trade commitment to buy $200 billion in American goods and services over the next two years. The country\u2019s purchase of U.S. goods increased last month as the economy continued its recovery from the coronavirus shutdowns, but imports are still far behind the pace needed to meet the terms of the phase one trade deal, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data from China\u2019s Customs Administration.U.S.-China struggles also may factor into the November presidential election. Former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton alleges in a new book that Trump asked Xi to help him win re-election by buying more farm products -- a claim the White House has dismissed as untrue.\u201cI don\u2019t expect one single blow to send this relationship in a tailspin,\u201d the chamber\u2019s Brilliant said. \u201cEach side will calibrate their reactions in a way that will not tip the scales too far.\u201dTake the recent spat over media access.

Treasury Secretary Mnuchin\u2019s statement that the US cannot shut down its economy again gave investors a boost of confidence \u2013 and this week\u2019s May retail sales report gave an even bigger one.This is the good news background lending credence a recent report from Morgan Stanley, on finding the advantageous tech position for a V-shaped recovery. The report, lead-authored by 5-star analyst Joseph Moore, details the strengths and weaknesses of the tech sector as companies respond to the economic recovery and the resumption of a more normal consumer activity. Moore pinpoints three tech stocks that are likely to gain \u2013 and upgrades their ratings in consequence.We\u2019ve used the TipRanks database to pull the details on these three tech stocks, to find out what makes them such compelling opportunities. Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)Qualcomm has a clear path forward as retail markets reopen. The semiconductor chip maker is heavily invested in both the smartphone market and the burgeoning 5G rollout, and both sectors are expected to expand dramatically with the resumption of consumer demand. The May retail numbers are relevant on this point, indicating that consumers are willing to spend and have the resources to do so.The company\u2019s forward prospects were blurred slightly by underperformance in 1H20 \u2013 but that underperformance should be taken with some careful skepticism. QCOM\u2019s calendar fourth quarter is historically the company\u2019s strongest, so declines in Q1 and Q2 were to be expected even without the coronavirus turndown. In the event, however, QCOM overperformed in both quarters, beating EPS and revenue expectations. Q1 saw $5.08 billion at the top line; Q2 saw an improvement to $5.22 billion.Reviewing QCOM shares for Morgan Stanley, analyst James Faucette upgrades the stock to Buy from Neutral, and supports his rating with a $102 price target. Faucette\u2019s target implies a healthy upside of 13% for the stock. (To watch Faucette\u2019s track record, click here)In his comments on QCOM, Faucette writes, \u201cWe see smartphone demand improving through the year, with a rising average selling price as we transition to 5G; volumes down 30% y/y in 2q should be a good entry point as we see consumption rebounding quickly.\u201d Overall, the Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating on QCOM still reflects Wall Street\u2019s recent caution in the markets. The 19 reviews on the stock break down as 11 Buys, 5 Holds, and 3 Sells. Shares are selling for $89.52, and the $91 average price target suggests a minimal upside of nearly 2%. (See Qualcomm stock analysis on TipRanks)Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO)Next on our list, Qorvo, is another chip maker. This company has a strong reputation and niche in the wifi segment, where it provides integrated circuits for networking communications hardware. Countless PCs, laptops, tablets, and smartphones use Qorvo chips, and the company\u2019s products are important in older applications such as cordless phones and industrial radio.Qorvo\u2019s solid niche position in the essential wireless tech industry helped insulate the stock from the economic turmoil of Q1 and Q2. Yes, the company saw revenues and earnings slip in both quarters, but in both cases the results were within the expectations of historical performance patterns. Calendar Q4 is QRVO\u2019s strongest, and the company beat the forecasts in both calendar Q1 and Q2.The most recent report, for the company\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter, shows the picture. QRVO saw revenue of $787.8 million, up 15% year-over-year, while the EPS of $1.57 beat the $1.32 forecast by a wide margin. QRVO\u2019s share price reflects the earnings and market position. The stock has recovered from the February-March dip, and is trading up 8% from pre-bear levels.Morgan Stanley\u2019s Craig Hettenbach, rated 5-stars in the TipRanks database, writes of QRVO: \u201cWe upgrade QRVO to Overweight on a recovery in mobile in 2H and expectation of further acceleration in 2021\u2026 We expect a cyclical rebound in smartphones, with 5G adoption adding another kicker as RF $ content should increase more than $5 per phone or over 30%...\u201dHettenbach supports his new Buy rating with a $130 that implies a one-year upside of 15% for the stock. (To watch Hettenback\u2019s track record, click here)QRVO shares have a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus. Wall Street\u2019s reviewers have posted 16 analyses of the stock, breaking down to 12 Buys and 4 Holds. Shares are trading now at $113.26, and the $119.85 average price target suggests the stock has room for a modest 6% growth. (See Qorvo stock analysis on TipRanks)Lam Research (LRCX)Last on our list of Morgan Stanley recommendations is Lam Research, a company with an interesting niche in the semiconductor industry. They don\u2019t make chips; rather, they specialize in wafer fabrication, the preparation of the silicon wafer from which chips are produced. Lam primary operations are the design, manufacture, and marketing of processing equipment used in front-end wafer processing. The company saw $9.7 billion in revenue last year, and netted $2.2 billion in income.For the most recent quarter, the company\u2019s fiscal third, LRCX reported strong results. $2.5 billion in revenue, 46% gross margins, and $3.88 EPS left management feeling confident.Joseph Moore wrote the Morgan Stanley review on LRCX, saying, \u201c\u2026buying these stocks near the bottom of the macroeconomic cycle requires looking through some uncertainty, and favor Lam over peers given the higher exposure to memory \u2013 particularly NAND \u2013 where we see trailing spending as well below normal, improving from here\u2026\u201dMoore upgrades LRCX from Neutral to Buy, and raises his price target from $253 to $334. His new target implies an upside of 9.3% for the coming year. (To watch Moore\u2019s track record, click here)LRCX has 21 recent analyst reviews, including 17 Buys and only 4 Holds. It\u2019s the most expensive stock on this list, currently selling for $312.65. The average price target, at $309.86, indicates that Wall Street generally is more cautious than the Morgan Stanley analyst team.

(NASDAQ: QCOM) was upgraded from Equal-weight to Overweight and the price target was moved up from $83 to $102.The Semiconductor Thesis The recession is bottoming out and is likely to be followed by a V-shaped recovery, Moore said in a Tuesday note. (See his track record here.)Against this backdrop, the analyst said it's worthwhile to shift his preference away from cloud and other compute stocks that he said have \"idiosyncratic\" momentum carrying them through the weakness.Instead, Moore said he prefers names that are likely to see one or two quarters of fundamental weakness but are more directly levered to an economic recovery, such as smartphones, memory and equipment and eventually auto and industrial.\"It's a shift from growth to cyclical, but also a shift from idiosyncratic growth drivers (which suddenly comes at a high price) to stocks that are more of a direct play on a robust rebound in consumer spending,\" the analyst said. Among its investment goals for the semiconductor sector, Morgan Stanley is maintaining at least market weightings on the sector and is taking profits in overvalued cloud names, he said. The analyst said he recommends increasing exposure to more cyclical elements by buying  smartphone chipmakers; pure cyclical exposure in semicap, with a focus on memory over foundry; and cyclical analog stocks that still have a tailwind of multiple expansion.Chipmakers with exposure to autos should see a bottom, as that sector is experiencing significant weakness, Moore said.The analyst also sees the new stimulus in Europe as being encouraging for semi companies with electric vehicle exposure.Morgan Stanley remains Underweight on stocks such as Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ: TXN), which has already seen significant multiple expansion, and ON Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ: ON), where Moore said margin performance is weak and competitive risks are rising.Semiconductor Price Action At the market close Tuesday:  * Intel shares were up 0.5% at $60.40.   * Nvidia was down 1.15% at $362.74.  * Qorvo gained 2.61% to $112.58.  * Lam Research shares rallied 5.34% to $305.48.  * Qualcomm was up 3.62% at $89.52.

Negotiations continue over the specifics of those incentives, he said without elaborating or identifying the site\u2019s location.The decision to situate a plant in Arizona came after White House officials warned about the threat inherent in having much of the world\u2019s electronics made outside of the U.S. TSMC had negotiated a deal with the administration to create American jobs and produce sensitive components domestically for national security reasons. It announced the project just before Washington leveled new restrictions on the sale of chips to Huawei, seeking to contain one of TSMC\u2019s largest customers.TSMC has set aside land adjacent to its selected plot and hopes to convince its own suppliers to set up operations in the vicinity over time, Liu added. They would join the likes of Intel Corp. and Micron Technologies Inc., which already operate facilities in the western state and have helped build a vibrant local semiconductor industry over the years. The scope of any eventual subsidies would require blessing from Congress, Liu added.\u201cSubsidies will be a key factor in TSMC\u2019s decision to set up a fab in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still talking to the U.S. government. Our request is that the state and federal governments together make up for the cost gap between the U.S. and Taiwan.\u201dRead more: TSMC Plans $12 Billion U.S. Chip Plant in Victory for TrumpTSMC is embarking on its U.S. endeavor during one of the most turbulent years in memory, with the coronavirus pandemic depressing the global economy and smartphone demand that top clients Apple and Huawei depend on for growth. The company, which in April trimmed its 2020 sales outlook, also finds itself in the crossfire as the Trump administration ratchets up a campaign to contain China. Washington last month barred any chipmaker using American equipment from supplying the networking giant without U.S. approval, effectively blocking Huawei\u2019s access to semiconductor manufacturing and dealing a blow to TSMC\u2019s business.The Taiwanese chipmaker hopes to keep supplying Huawei but is confident other customers can replace any business lost because of tightening U.S. curbs on China\u2019s largest tech company. TSMC is studying the latest restrictions and is hopeful the issue will get resolved over time, Liu told shareholders Tuesday. Liu declined to comment when asked whether TSMC had already ceased taking orders from the Chinese company.But Liu reaffirmed TSMC\u2019s projections for 2020, saying it still planned to spend as much as $16 billion this year on capacity upgrades and technology, and foresees a mid- to high-teens percentage rise in 2020 revenue.Shareholders \u201ccan rest assured that we will resolve these new restrictions one by one. We will find a solution to continue to grow and secure more profits for our shareholders,\u201d Liu said at Tuesday\u2019s annual general meeting. \u201cIf there are no more HiSilicon orders, our other customers will want to fill the gap in our capacity, market share, or smartphone market share left by Huawei. How fast they can fill that gap depends.\u201dRead more: Huawei Sees Dire Threat to Future From Latest Trump SalvoWashington\u2019s curbs -- a more precise strike against Huawei because it targets its secretive and cutting-edge HiSilicon semiconductor division -- threaten to wreak havoc throughout the complex chip ecosystem that produces technology for consumers and companies globally.As the world\u2019s largest and most advanced maker of chips for other companies, TSMC plays a crucial role in the production of devices from smartphones and laptops to servers running the internet. Huawei is TSMC\u2019s largest customer after Apple and accounts for about 14% of the Taiwanese chipmaker\u2019s sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Taiwanese firm may now have to cut off Huawei unless it gets waivers from the Commerce Department. But additional business from existing clients like Apple, Qualcomm Inc., MediaTek Inc. or Advanced Micro Devices Inc. could help offset a decline in orders.For TSMC, it\u2019s growing ever more difficult to remain neutral amid the growing tensions between the U.S. and China. The company brands itself \u201ceverybody\u2019s foundry,\u201d effectively the Switzerland of the tech industry -- something executives reiterated on Tuesday. It supplies not just Chinese customers like Huawei but also the American military, while relying on U.S. producers of semiconductor-making equipment like Applied Materials Inc. and Lam Research Corp.\u201cNew restrictions can lead to a rebalancing among market players,\u201d Liu told reporters. Huawei \u201cwill not be able to make smartphones in the future without semiconductors, and other smartphone brands will eat into its market share.\u201d\u201cWe will still have a high market share after the rebalancing,\u201d he added.Read more: U.S.-China Fight Over Chip Kingpin Rattles Tech IndustryFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-confident-replacing-huawei-orders-030246275.html"}, {"symbol": "LRCX", "publishedDate": "2020-06-08 17:00:41", "title": "US's surgical strike on HiSilicon threatens to cripple Huawei - TechCentral", "image": "https://techcentral.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kirin-990-2156-1120.jpg", "site": "https://techcentral.co.za", "text": "The Trump administration has fired multiple salvos against Huawei since the start of a campaign to derail China\u2019s technological ascendancy.

The latest blow threatens to cripple the country\u2019s tech champion.Huawei\u2019s leafy campus in southern China has been engulfed in a state of emergency since the Commerce Department in May banned the sale of any silicon made with U.S. know-how -- striking at the heart of its semiconductor apparatus and aspirations in fields from artificial intelligence to mobile services. Its stockpiles of certain self-designed chips essential to telecom equipment will run out by early 2021, according to people familiar with the matter.Executives scurried between meetings in the days after the latest restrictions, according to one person who attended the discussions. But the company has so far failed to brainstorm a solution to the curbs, they added, asking not to be identified talking about private matters. While Huawei can buy off-the-shelf or commodity mobile chips from a third party like Samsung Electronics Co. or MediaTek Inc., it couldn\u2019t possibly get enough and may have to make costly compromises on performance in basic products, they added.What Huawei\u2019s brass fears is that Washington, after a year of Entity List sanctions that\u2019ve failed to significantly curtail the company\u2019s rapid growth, has finally figured out how to quash its ambitions. The latest curbs are the culmination of a concerted assault against China\u2019s largest tech company that began years ago, when the White House tried to cut off the flow of American software and circuitry; lobbied allies from the U.K. to Australia to banish its network gear; even persuaded Canadian police to lock up the founder\u2019s daughter. The latest measures however are a more surgical strike leveled at HiSilicon, the secretive division created 16 years ago to drive research into cutting-edge fields like AI inference chips. That unit surged in prominence precisely because it\u2019s viewed as a savior in an era of American containment, and its silicon now matches rivals\u2019 like Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s and powers many of Huawei\u2019s products: the Kirin for phones, Ascend for AI and Kunpeng for servers.Now that ambition is in doubt. Every chipmaker on the planet, from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to China\u2019s own Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., needs gear from American outfits like Applied Materials Inc. to fabricate chipsets. Should Washington get serious about throttling that spigot, Huawei won\u2019t be able to get any of the advanced silicon it designs into the real world -- stymieing efforts to craft its own processors for mobile devices and radio frequency chips for 5G base stations, to name just two of the most vital in-house components. Dubbed the Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule or DPR, Trump\u2019s latest constraints have implications for China\u2019s 5G rollout, for which Huawei is by far the dominant purveyor.The ban \u201cfocuses on HiSilicon-designed chips, which present the biggest threat to the U.S.,\u201d Jefferies analyst Edison Lee wrote in late May. \u201cThe DPR could quash HiSilicon and then Huawei\u2019s ability to make 5G network gears.\u201dRead more: U.S.-China Fight Over Chip Kingpin Rattles Tech IndustryThe scene at Huawei\u2019s Shenzhen nerve center invokes deja vu from a year ago, when Huawei billionaire Ren Zhengfei emerged from seclusion to declare his company\u2019s survival in doubt. In the months following that proclamation, two things happened. U.S. companies, spooked by the prospect of losing billions, lobbied Washington for exceptions to the Entity List and suppliers from Intel Corp. to Micron Technology Inc. relocated assembly to increase foreign-produced components and continue supplying the Chinese company. Huawei employees -- spurred on by patriotism given perceptions the nation was under attack -- went to 24-hour days to design alternatives to American parts.The latest curbs could prove more effective because they remove Huawei\u2019s chipmaker of choice from the equation. In theory, any chipmaker can petition the Commerce department for approval to ship Huawei-designed semiconductors, and opinion is divided on both sides of the Pacific as to how far the agency will allow shipments to proceed. But if it chooses to enforce the new curbs to the hilt, HiSilicon can no longer take its designs to TSMC or any foreign contract manufacturer. And local peers such as SMIC typically operate two generations behind TSMC.In fact, the latest curbs could severely disrupt production of some of the more critical and visible products in Huawei\u2019s portfolio, including the Kirin brains and communications chips of future 5G phones, AI learning chips for its cloud services and servers and the most basic kinds of chips for networking. In February, Huawei touted how its next-generation antenna chips have been installed in \u201cthe industry\u2019s highest-performance\u201d 5G base stations. It may no longer able to ship those base stations after the chip inventory runs out.\u201cHiSilicon won\u2019t be able to continue its innovation any further until it\u2019s able to find alternatives through self-development and collaboration with local ones, which will take years to mature,\u201d said Charlie Dai, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. \u201cWe estimate that Huawei\u2019s inventory of high-end chips (including baseband chips and CPUs for Huawei\u2019s high-end smartphones) may last 12 to 18 months maximum.\u201dRead about how Trump\u2019s blacklisting of Huawei failed to halt its growth.Modern chip manufacturing at the highest levels simply cannot happen without American gear from the likes of Applied Materials, KLA Corp. and Lam Research Corp. Even in basic wafer fabrication, replacing TSMC is impossible because the Taiwanese foundry is the only company able to reliably make semiconductors using 7 nanometer or smaller nodes -- a must for high performance. Moving everything in-house -- essentially building an American-free plant -- is a pipe dream because it requires extreme ultraviolet lithography machines from ASML Holding NV -- a prerequisite for next-generation chipmaking. Yet ASML\u2019s machines also use American technology from the likes of suppliers such as II-VI Inc. and Lumentum Holdings Inc, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The best Chinese alternative could be Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment, but its EUVs are again a few generations behind the Dutch firm\u2019s.All that\u2019s even before factoring in the uncertainty over Huawei\u2019s access to design software developed by Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Synopsys Inc. The pair provide electronic design automation (EDA) tools that Hisilicon\u2019s engineers rely on to draw up blueprints for next-generation processors. As Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Nonproliferation Christopher Ford told reporters in late May: \u201cIf one wants to be working in the area of the very best chips, the chips that have the most computing power packed into the smallest space, it is necessary to use U.S. design tools right now because we have a commanding comparative advantage in that area.\u201d\u201cWhile there will be lots of opportunity to continue selling lesser quality chips to Huawei, this will be an additional challenge for the really good stuff,\u201d he added.How Huawei Landed at the Center of Global Tech Tussle: QuickTakeIn the long run, the lack of consistent in-house chip supplies will disrupt China\u2019s grand ambition of challenging the U.S. for global tech supremacy. More immediately, they threaten to curtail China\u2019s crucial $500 billion 5G rollout -- a key piece of Beijing\u2019s longer-term strategic vision.Huawei stands at the center of Beijing\u2019s $1.4 trillion New Infrastructure initiative to seize the lead in 5G-based technology. Now it\u2019s uncertain if it can even fulfill the 90-plus contracts it\u2019s won so far to build networks for local operators like China Mobile Ltd. and other carriers around the world. That\u2019s because HiSilicon\u2019s chips are essential in products waiting to be shipped out. The uncertainty of not just fulfilling contracts -- but also around Huawei\u2019s very ability to maintain clients\u2019 networks once they\u2019re up and running -- may also spook potential future customers.Internally, executives remain hopeful of finding a workaround, and are repeating the same mantra of a year ago -- doing without American technology isn\u2019t impossible. \u201cThe good news is we still have time,\u201d said one person involved in Huawei\u2019s supply chain management. Chip architecture and supply \u201credesign takes time, but not something that can\u2019t be done.\u201d(Updates with table of Huawei\u2019s chipmaking options after the tenth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-troops-see-dire-threat-210000676.html"}, {"symbol": "LRCX", "publishedDate": "2020-06-08 01:33:51", "title": "Huawei troops see dire threat to future from latest Trump salvo", "image": "https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Huawei_reuters_9.jpg?null", "site": "https://www.theedgemarkets.com", "text": "(June 8): The Trump administration has fired multiple salvos against Huawei Technologies Co. since the start of a campaign to derail China\u2019s technological ascendancy.
