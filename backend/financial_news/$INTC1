SK Hynix said the companies expect to get required governmental approvals for the deal by late 2021. \n The transaction, if completed, could reportedly make SK Hynix the world's second-largest provider of NAND flash memory chips behind Samsung Electronics, another South Korean chip giant. \n Demand for flash memory has strengthened in recent months due to buying of personal computers and servers as the coronavirus pandemic forces millions to work from home. \n Intel said it plans to invest proceeds from the transaction into advancing long-growth priorities, including technologies related to artificial intelligence and fifth-generation wireless networks. \n \"This transaction will allow us to further prioritize our investments in differentiated technology where we can play a bigger role in the success of our customers and deliver attractive returns to our stockholders,\" Bob Swan, Intel's CEO, said in a statement.", "url": "https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Intel-to-sell-NAND-business-to-SKorean-rival-for-15659999.php"}, {"symbol": "INTC", "publishedDate": "2020-10-20 08:24:03", "title": "INTEL CORP : JP Morgan reiterates its Buy rating | MarketScreener", "image": "https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdgris.png", "site": "https://www.marketscreener.com", "text": "", "url": "https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/INTEL-CORPORATION-4829/news/INTEL-CORP-JP-Morgan-reiterates-its-Buy-rating-31571775/"}, {"symbol": "INTC", "publishedDate": "2020-10-20 07:55:00", "title": "Intel poised to sell NAND business to South Korea's SK Hynix for almost $10 bln", "image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/10/20/905274.JPG", "site": "https://www.thestar.com.my", "text": "Intel Corp is preparing to sell its NAND memory chip business to SK Hynix Inc for almost $10 billion in a deal that would propel the South Korean chipmaker to second in the global rankings, two sources familiar with the matter said.", "url": "https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2020/10/20/intel-poised-to-sell-nand-business-to-south-korea039s-sk-hynix-for-almost-10-bln"}, {"symbol": "INTC", "publishedDate": "2020-10-20 07:20:49", "title": "Intel agrees to sell storage unit to SK Hynix for $9 billion", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/10/SK-Hynix.jpg", "site": "https://indianexpress.com", "text": "Intel has said for months it was exploring options for the flash group.
