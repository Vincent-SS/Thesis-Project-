Hamburgers are still getting grilled, trips to national parks are being plotted and air conditioners are\u00a0cranked on full blast.That last point is taking on new meaning as the country continues its reopening in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Even New York City \u2014\u00a0the region hardest hit by the pandemic and the last in the country to emerge from lockdown \u2014\u00a0is on track to allow people to interact again in non-essential indoor venues starting\u00a0Monday. Barber shops, retail stores and offices will be able to reopen, with some restrictions and safeguards, and the HVAC systems that keep them cool and ventilated will come whirring back to life. Chances are you didn\u2019t give much thought to those HVAC systems in the before-times, as long as they appeared to be working. Now, with a potentially deadly virus that spreads via airborne droplets still circulating around the country,\u00a0you might be wondering, are\u00a0air conditioners safe?The short answer is yes,\u00a0with the irritating caveat that it depends on the HVAC system and the circumstances of the space. The most tricked-out, sophisticated air-conditioner money can buy isn\u2019t going to make much of a difference if people are packed in like sardines on a subway car or at a concert venue and an infected person starts coughing. But the presence of air conditioning likely\u00a0doesn't\u00a0in and of itself increase your risk of getting the coronavirus. In fact, combined with social distancing, personal hygiene\u00a0and face masks, proper ventilation and humidity control are actually great\u00a0tools for guarding against infection.\u00a0A typical air-conditioner system works by taking in a certain percentage of air from the outside and mixing it with air that\u2019s recirculated from within the building. When you\u2019re trying to combat a virus, you want more air to come in from the outside, where it\u2019s unaffected by whatever sneezes or coughs may be happening in a certain corner of the office.\u00a0But even the recirculated air gets passed through a filter before it\u2019s spat out from one room to the next. The gold standard is a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter\u00a0and the next best thing is a filter with a minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) of at least 13 (higher numbers are better),\u00a0both of which are\u00a0capable of\u00a0capturing\u00a0small particles such as viruses.A study published on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s website linked\u00a0the spread of the coronavirus among patrons of a Guangzhou, China, restaurant to air conditioners. But a followup analysis showed there was no outdoor air supply; that particular air conditioner was operating only with recirculated air, according to William Bahnfleth, a professor of architectural engineering at Pennsylvania State University and the chair of the epidemic taskforce for the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers.\u201cWhen we see reports of super-spreading events that apparently involve air conditioning, it usually means there\u2019s little or no ventilation in the space,\u201d Bahnfleth\u00a0said in a phone interview. Unlike other pathogens such as\u00a0tuberculosis,\u00a0Covid-19 doesn\u2019t appear to be so infectious that it can spread between people in\u00a0different parts of a building via air\u00a0that\u2019s\u00a0been diluted through ventilation and filtration, he said. \u201cInfection is analogous to being poisoned,\u201d Bahnfleth said. \u201cYou can have one drink and you\u2019re fine, but if you drink a whole bottle of hard liquor, you may die. With pathogens, it\u2019s similar. It\u00a0takes a certain number of them to have a high probability of getting an infection. If you can reduce the concentration in the air, then the rate at which you can be exposed drops.\u201d\u00a0The good news is that in the U.S., there are already minimum standards for ventilation based on square footage and expected occupancy. These usually evolve out of recommendations from the ASHRAE trade organization and\u00a0are set by local governments as part of\u00a0the building\u00a0code. While there are discrepancies between regions \u2014\u00a0California, for example, is one of the most progressive in terms of air-quality requirements \u2014 these basic standards are \u201creasonably protective,\u201d\u00a0Bahnfleth said.\u00a0That\u2019s why the most important step for any business\u00a0is to do a full checkup\u00a0and proper maintenance of\u00a0existing systems before they start letting people back into their building,\u00a0Chris Nelson, president of Carrier Global Corp.\u2019s HVAC division, said in a phone interview.Carrier,\u00a0Trane Technologies Plc\u00a0and other HVAC companies are offering\u00a0indoor air-quality tests and restart services for buildings that have gone unoccupied for long stretches.\u00a0This can help companies assess\u00a0whether\u00a0they\u2019re getting proper\u00a0air distribution and the appropriate influx of outside air,\u00a0and to ensure filters are clean. When it comes to evaluating what upgrades are necessary, \u201crather than say here's the \u2018right\u2019 solution, we want to look at your system and equipment and see how the building operates,\u201d Andrew Mondell, Trane\u2019s business development manager for New York City, said in a phone interview. \u201cThen we can think about what's possible and how it fits into budget constraints.\u201dThe\u00a0free fix\u00a0if you\u2019re not getting enough ventilation is to just open the windows, although clearly that\u2019s easier said than done in hot and humid places such as\u00a0Texas and Florida, where restaurant-goers might complain that they didn\u2019t order a side of sweat with their fries. \u201cAs people are coming back to work and businesses are recovering, we\u2019re cognizant of offering options people can afford right now,\u201d Nelson of Carrier said. One such\u00a0relatively pain-free and cheap upgrade is to change your filters to a higher\u00a0efficiency. Another is to\u00a0adjust an HVAC system\u2019s parameters to increase the amount of air coming in from the outside relative to the amount that\u2019s recirculated. How easy this is depends on the particular system but for many, it's a simple tweak with the help of a professional.The next level up is to look into an air scrubber with a HEPA filter.\u00a0Carrier\u2019s version is the\u00a0OptiClean Negative Air Machine, which Nelson says has drawn interest from health-care institutions and for the common areas of hotels and universities. It can also be used to create pressure that prevents air from spreading between one area and\u00a0another. Because these machines are portable, there\u2019s not much in the way of installation costs, so it\u00a0can be a relatively inexpensive investment.\u00a0You can also add virus-killing ultra-violet light filters or other air-cleaning technology such as\u00a0bipolar ionization to your HVAC system for\u00a0another layer of protection. The cost of something like that scales pretty dramatically based on the type of equipment and\u00a0size of a building, from maybe a few thousand dollars for smaller, simpler jobs to many times that for a massive office building,\u00a0says Trane\u2019s Mondell.\u00a0If you\u2019re really hitting a wall on more basic ventilation and filtration fixes, you may want to\u00a0replace your HVAC system\u00a0with a more modern one, which is usually the most expensive route.\u00a0For consumers, this all sounds great in theory, but how do you know what businesses have made\u00a0these assessments and upgrades\u00a0and which haven\u2019t? The truth is, without a technical background and a look inside the HVAC system, you\u00a0don\u2019t. But there are some things\u00a0you can watch out for. Odor or mustiness can be\u00a0a sign of poor ventilation. While some window AC units do allow for ventilation, they typically aren\u2019t very effective at bringing in\u00a0outside air, Bahnfleth said.\u00a0So if a business relies on one and isn\u2019t doing something else to dilute the concentration of potential virus particles in the air like opening windows or limiting occupancy, that can be a worry point. Bathrooms sometimes get shoved in wherever they fit, particularly in smaller enterprises, and often\u00a0aren\u2019t well-ventilated. A\u00a0study\u00a0published this week in the journal Physics of Fluids found that flushing the toilet can create a cloud of aerosol droplets that rises nearly three feet and may linger in the air or land on nearby surfaces, according to the New York Times. Keeping the exhaust fan running should help, Mondell said, and the bathroom\u00a0could also be a good spot\u00a0for an air-scrubber.\u00a0The net of it, though, is that when it comes to both the coronavirus specifically and health and well-being overall, it\u2019s\u00a0better to have a good\u00a0air-conditioning\u00a0system than to not have one.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.
