Weight Watchers, Pools and Cereal", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- One of the more striking features of the pandemic is the inequity of the pain it has inflicted. It\u00a0has disproportionately affected Black and Latino communities. More than 16 million Americans are unemployed, nearly triple February\u2019s levels, but investors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index are back in the green for the year. And while some businesses are looking at a multiyear slump in demand, others are experiencing\u00a0their best sales growth ever. The second-quarter earnings season brought fresh evidence of relative bright spots for spending, from the obvious demand for cleaning products to more surprising splurges like swimming pools and Weight Watchers memberships. That\u2019s a shift from the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009.\u00a0You\u00a0would be hard pressed to name large companies that didn\u2019t experience some\u00a0sort of a slowdown\u00a0from\u00a0that particular recession, let alone any that were outright beneficiaries. There are no real winners in a global pandemic that has killed more than 150,000 people in the U.S., but the willingness of at least some Americans to keep spending on certain categories is a positive indicator and has most likely served to keep the\u00a0economic downturn from being even worse. Here\u2019s what stood out:BIG-TICKET ITEMSThe unique nature of the pandemic and months spent under lockdown conditions has some consumers making the kind of large\u00a0discretionary purchases that are typically the first to get cut in a downturn.\u00a0New-home sales in the U.S. rose to an almost 13-year high in June, while purchases of existing homes posted the largest ever month-over-month gain as families juggling\u00a0the work-from-home and virtual-learning experiments seek out bigger properties in less-urban areas. Much of this home-buying now starts virtually.\u00a0That translated into a 12% gain in\u00a0monthly users on\u00a0Zillow Group Inc.\u2019s sites during the second quarter.\u00a0Better-than-expected sales growth in its internet and mortgages divisions should push the company\u2019s third-quarter operating profit above the threshold it was targeting internally before the pandemic, Chief Financial Officer\u00a0Allen Parker said on an earnings call last week. High on the list of priorities for some home shoppers is going to be\u00a0a parking spot. A\u00a0wariness of public transportation and ride-sharing\u00a0has underscored the appeal of individual cars and helped the sector bounce back much more quickly than anticipated. General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. both reported better-than-expected second-quarter results amid a strong gain\u00a0in sales once dealerships and plants were allowed to reopen in May and June. Both could\u00a0return to profitability next quarter, a sharp contrast to the financial crisis when\u00a0GM\u00a0and Chrysler were forced into bankruptcy and Ford only barely avoided the same fate.\u00a0OUTDOOR LIVING\u00a0\u00a0The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0says outdoor activities are less risky than indoor ones,\u00a0and many people are growing tired of being cooped up at home.\u00a0No wonder RV-maker Thor Industries Inc. cited an \u201cinflux\u201d of first-time buyers. Camping World Holdings Inc.\u00a0said this month that demand had remained strong through the summer months and that it might be on track for its most profitable year ever.\u00a0Yeti Holdings Inc. posted an 18% increase in second-quarter sales\u00a0for\u00a0the division that includes its luxury\u00a0coolers, waterproof backpacks and fancy camping chairs.\u00a0If you can\u2019t drive your RV to the beach or a campsite on a lake, the next best option is to create your own personal waterfront oasis. Pool Corp., a distributor of parts and supplies, reported record sales in the second quarter and increased its earnings guidance for 2020. Pool filled most of that demand from existing inventory, but the revenue boom will eventually make its way to Pentair Plc, which makes\u00a0pool pumps, cleaners and automated control systems. Orders are up for both new pool construction and remodels, CEO\u00a0John Stauch said on the company\u2019s earnings call last month. With most new pools taking several quarters to complete, that\u2019s not the kind of investment that\u2019s made lightly and not one that\u2019s common in economic slumps. Global sales of pool equipment at Pentair fell 45% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, for example.\u00a0HOME IMPROVEMENTSadly, a pool remains out of reach for most people. But it\u2019s also seemingly a\u00a0good time to do something about that cabinet that has never closed properly, replace that appliance that\u2019s making ominous noises or build that new deck.\u00a0Stanley Black & Decker Inc. rode the do-it-yourself wave to 8% organic sales growth in its tools segment in June and July, compared with the year-earlier periods.\u00a0Whirlpool Corp. said revenue declines in 2020 wouldn\u2019t be as bad as previously thought, as an initial spike in demand for extra refrigerators and freezers to store all that food people were stockpiling gave way to other upgrades in the kitchen, such as\u00a0ovens. HVAC systems have been another spending hot spot\u00a0because a broken air conditioner makes spending 24/7 inside a home even more of a challenge. Proper ventilation is also a critical\u00a0tool for combating the coronavirus. Orders for residential HVAC systems were up 100% in June compared with those in the month a year earlier and trending up more than 50%\u00a0in July at Carrier Global Corp., with similar spikes at rivals Trane Technologies Plc and Johnson Controls International Plc. People are also paying closer attention to their yards.\u00a0Scotts Miracle-Gro Co.\u2019s\u00a0revenue surged 28% in the quarter ended June 27,\u00a0thanks to robust demand for\u00a0gardening and lawn-care products.\u00a0The sales surge prompted the company to raise its full-year earnings outlook.SELF-IMPROVEMENTOther Americans have apparently made a project of themselves. Rosetta Stone Inc. reported a 92% increase in bookings from a year earlier in its consumer language segment\u00a0as people decided to use time stuck at home to learn Spanish or brush up on their Italian.\u00a0That uptake, coupled with increased sales of its literacy products for K-12 students, led the company to boost full-year sales guidance. Rosetta Stone is reportedly looking to capitalize on the demand boom with a potential sale.\u00a0Meanwhile, WW International Inc., the company behind Weight Watchers, notched 5 million subscribers in the second quarter \u2014\u00a0a count that was about even with the first quarter, the period that is typically peak season thanks to New Year\u2019s resolutions. The pandemic is prompting a \u201cradical re-appraisal\u201d of life and work in which \u201chealth and wellness is definitely moving from what I would think of prior as a luxury to a necessity,\u201d CEO Mindy Grossman said at a recent conference. WW\u2019s quarterly revenue fell from a year earlier, as many of its brick-and-mortar studios were temporarily closed because of the pandemic. But digital subscriptions \u2014\u00a0a more profitable model that the company is trying to pivot toward anyway \u2014\u00a0rose 23%.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CONSTANT CLEANINGThe pandemic has put hygiene and sanitization into sharp focus. That has shown up in obvious ways, such as a 22% surge in sales for Clorox Co. in the second quarter and a 19% increase in sales of 3M Co.\u2019s personal-protective gear, including N95 masks.\u00a0Cintas Corp. is known for its corporate uniforms, but it also helps supply companies with items like hand-sanitizer and masks. Sales for the unit that houses this business grew 22% in the most recent quarter on an organic basis, with demand for safety products more than making up for a decline in the restocking of office first-aid cabinets. It\u2019s not just disinfectants, though. With people spending so many more hours at home, the dishes are piling up more frequently and the floors are becoming grimy faster. That helped power sales of\u00a0Procter & Gamble Co.\u2019s\u00a0Dawn dish soap and Swiffer brands in the quarter, which contributed to a 14% increase in organic sales\u00a0in the company\u2019s fabric and\u00a0home care division.\u00a0Colgate-Palmolive Co., too, said it was struggling to keep up with sustained demand for dish soap.\u00a0Reynolds Consumer Products Inc.\u00a0recorded a double-digit\u00a0increase in sales in its Hefty\u00a0waste and storage bags unit as people generate more trash at home. Americans are also reluctant to share homes that may already feel a bit crowded with bugs and other pests. Rollins Inc., a pest-control company that operates under the Orkin brand among others, said it had outpaced its previous 10\u00a0best sales days during the second quarter and the month of July, largely through inbound call volume.\u00a0IN THE KITCHEN\u00a0Americans have been eating more meals and snacks at home amid widespread teleworking and safety concerns about visiting restaurants. The chaos of the outside world also has many people reaching for comfort food. Demand for previously forsaken goods like cereal and frozen foods is lifting sales at companies such as\u00a0Kellogg Co., which raised its guidance for the full year.\u00a0Newell Brands Inc., the company behind Crock-Pots and Calphalon nonstick pans, said sales at U.S. retailers of its appliances and cookware products were up \u201cdouble-digits\u201d from a year ago.\u00a0The stay-at-home lifestyle and a reluctance to venture into grocery stores has also benefited meal-kit maker\u00a0HelloFresh SE, which increased its ranks of global active customers to 4.2 million in the most recent quarter, up from 2.4\u00a0million a year earlier. Its smaller, U.S.-based rival,\u00a0Blue Apron Holdings Inc., also had an increase in demand. Crucially, both companies experienced a jump in orders per customer, a sign that the services are becoming more of a habit for their users.\u00a0This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.
