Adem\u00e1s creen que que permitir\u00eda agilizar tr\u00e1mites en el \u00e1mbito p\u00fablico y privado, con la emisi\u00f3n de certificados electr\u00f3nicos cualificados. Y que esto a su vez permitir\u00eda un ahorro y una mejora de la eficiencia sustancial para la administraci\u00f3n, y aflorar una parte considerable de la econom\u00eda sumergida, liberando casi un 14% del PIB.Expertos de Espa\u00f1a y Latinoam\u00e9rica analizar\u00e1n desaf\u00edos y oportunidades de blockchain en el sector financiero\u00a0En ese contexto, destacaron cinco claves para entender la importancia de la identidad digital en Espa\u00f1a. A continuaci\u00f3n los detalles seg\u00fan AEFI:*eIDAS, una directiva pendiente de desarrollar en Espa\u00f1aEl eIDAS (reglamento europeo que establece un marco jur\u00eddico com\u00fan para los servicios de confianza y los medios de identificaci\u00f3n electr\u00f3nica) se aprob\u00f3 en 2016, pero todav\u00eda no se aplica en su potencialidad en Espa\u00f1a. Supone para la identidad lo que fue el euro para la moneda en 1999: la homogeneizaci\u00f3n de un asunto fundamental para la creaci\u00f3n de un Mercado \u00danico Digital. Se trata del germen del DNI europeo, con el que m\u00e1s de 500 millones de ciudadanos y miles de empresas podr\u00e1n realizar transacciones electr\u00f3nicas seguras y confiables, que antes requer\u00edan un acto de identificaci\u00f3n en presencia f\u00edsica, pero ahora de manera online, estableciendo un marco de actuaci\u00f3n totalmente novedoso y un lenguaje econ\u00f3mico com\u00fan para las operaciones entre administraci\u00f3n, empresas y ciudadanos.\u00a0\u00a0Registraron la marca y el logotipo de Bitcoin en la Oficina Espa\u00f1ola de Patentes y Marcas*Espa\u00f1a, una anomal\u00eda en EuropaEl \u201cReal Decreto-Ley 11/2020, de 31 de marzo, por el que se adoptaron medidas urgentes complementarias en el \u00e1mbito social y econ\u00f3mico para hacer frente al COVID-19, autoriz\u00f3 la emisi\u00f3n de certificados electr\u00f3nicos cualificados por parte de los Prestadores Cualificados de Servicios de Confianza, de forma totalmente online. Sin embargo, unas puntualizaciones restrictivas, realizadas por la Subdirecci\u00f3n General para la Sociedad Digital, limitaban el efecto de esta autorizaci\u00f3n, acotando sus usos y ordenando la revocaci\u00f3n de los certificados, una vez finalizara el estado de alarma.*La digitalizaci\u00f3n de la Administraci\u00f3n, una asignatura pendienteEspa\u00f1a no supera el 20% de madurez en la digitalizaci\u00f3n de la Administraci\u00f3n P\u00fablica, si se tiene en cuenta el grado de avance de los tr\u00e1mites digitales y el uso por la parte de los ciudadanos. La cantidad de identidades, DNIe y certificados FNMT existentes mantienen un uso casi residual (menos del 1%), debido a la dificultad de uso y de acceso a la misma, encontr\u00e1ndose este uso circunscrito principalmente a tr\u00e1mites obligatorios para aut\u00f3nomos y empresas con la Agencia Tributaria.Sectores regulados como el financiero o el de las telecomunicaciones ya pueden adquirir clientes online en cualquier momento y parte del mundo y la Administraci\u00f3n P\u00fablica lo necesitar\u00e1 en el escenario post-covid19, para apoyar la reactivaci\u00f3n de la econom\u00eda y facilitar el acceso a los ciudadanos a sus servicios. Se estima que el Mercado \u00danico Digital podr\u00e1 generar m\u00e1s de 30 Billones de euros en el mercado europeo en los pr\u00f3ximos cinco a\u00f1os, convirti\u00e9ndose en el principal impulsor de la competencia en sectores clave de la econom\u00eda, incluida la Administraci\u00f3n P\u00fablica, favoreciendo los servicios en sectores tales como el financiero, el sanitario, las telecomunicaciones, la econom\u00eda colaborativa, el paso de fronteras, el transporte y la movilidad e incluso la democracia electr\u00f3nica y la participaci\u00f3n ciudadana.Tras levantar m\u00e1s de 72 millones de euros, llega a Espa\u00f1a la fintech danesa Pleo*Espa\u00f1a, un pa\u00eds pionero en soluciones de identificaci\u00f3n que no aprovecha su ventaja competitivaPese al retraso en la aplicaci\u00f3n de la normativa comunitaria eiDAS, Espa\u00f1a fue un pa\u00eds pionero en la implantaci\u00f3n de soluciones que permit\u00edan la identificaci\u00f3n a distancia aceptadas e impulsadas por el SEPBLA que, durante el a\u00f1o 2019 en Espa\u00f1a, permitieron identificar a m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de usuarios en el mercado financiero con m\u00e1ximo nivel de seguridad. No obstante, esta ventaja competitiva que permite la normativa est\u00e1 quedando relegada frente a modelos como el italiano o el alem\u00e1n, pese a que dichos sistemas, son m\u00e1s ineficientes y se encuentran en retroceso por su alto coste y complejidad. En este sentido, algunos Prestadores de Servicios de Confianza espa\u00f1oles est\u00e1n ya est\u00e1n notando los efectos de esta falta de visi\u00f3n, siendo adquiridos por prestadores hom\u00f3logos de otros pa\u00edses que no cuentan con tantas ataduras en el reto digital.*El desarrollo de la identidad digital, un elemento vital para impulsar la econom\u00eda y apoyar la transformaci\u00f3n de la sociedad y los nuevos modelos productivos en el escenario post COVID-19La identidad digital, sencilla de obtener y f\u00e1cil de usar, a pleno rendimiento, permitir\u00eda que el Estado pudiera funcionar en tiempo real y liberar un impacto de hasta un 13,6% del PIB, seg\u00fan un estudio elaborado por Mc Kinsey (...). Adem\u00e1s, la identidad digital es clave en la introducci\u00f3n de la moneda y pagos electr\u00f3nicos, para eliminar el dinero en papel, lo que podr\u00eda suponer un ahorro de 600 millones anuales.\u00a0Te puede interesar:Expertos de Espa\u00f1a y Latinoam\u00e9rica analizar\u00e1n desaf\u00edos y oportunidades de blockchain en el sector financieroRegistraron la marca y el logotipo de Bitcoin en la Oficina Espa\u00f1ola de Patentes y MarcasTras levantar m\u00e1s de 72 millones de euros, llega a Espa\u00f1a la fintech danesa PleoFintech estoniana askRobin sale a competir en Am\u00e9rica LatinaEspa\u00f1a: La CNMV advierte sobre varias entidades no autorizadas para prestar servicios de inversi\u00f3nBitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Monero, TRON: An\u00e1lisis de precios, 26 de noviembre (2018)Desde Paxful afirman que se registr\u00f3 un significativo incremento del intercambio de criptomonedas en Argentina", "url": "https://blockboard.net/es/cinco-claves-para-entender-la-importancia-de-la-identidad-digital-en-espana/"}, {"symbol": "ANET", "publishedDate": "2020-07-01 10:18:50", "title": "New Mexico Educational Retirement Board Lowers Stock Position in Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET)", "image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/arista-networks-inc-logo.gif", "site": "https://www.thelincolnianonline.com", "text": "New Mexico Educational Retirement Board decreased its position in shares of Arista Networks Inc (NYSE:ANET) by 17.1% during the 1st quarter, according to its most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
