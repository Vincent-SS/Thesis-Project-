Shares spiked up to $20 in June as hopes of a V-shaped recovery emerged. Since then, however, the novel coronavirus formed a second wave. U.S. passenger traffic stalled, and with it, so did the airline stocks. AAL stock fell back to just $11 a share.Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com Now, however, it's on the mend. Hopes of more government aid are leading the turnaround. Last week, news agencies reported that a large number of Republican senators are willing to extend more payroll assistance to the airlines to keep their employees backstopped through the end of 2020. Employee Layoffs and Government AidAs things stand now, the current government payroll assistance is set to run out next month. When it ends, the airlines are planning major employee furloughs, and they've already been paying out early retirement bonuses to get older employees to quit. Delta (NYSE:DAL), for example, is letting go of a fifth of its staff via buyouts and early retirements.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo, additional government aid or not, the airlines are shrinking their workforces dramatically. That's logical, as traffic isn't likely to get back to 2019 levels until 2023, according to reports from industry analysts such as Moody's. And there is almost zero chance the government will be backstopping the industry all the way through 2023.It's worth noting that the U.S. airline industry didn't return to overall profitability until 2007 after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Airlines earn single-digit profit margins when things are going right. Running a negative 50% or negative 75% profit margin for a year destroys profits from many good years, and often forces an airline through Chapter 11 reorganization or a total liquidation.  * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short ListI don't get the sense that traders have really worked through the math on what it would take for the airlines to recover. And American's situation is particularly dire as it is the most indebted of the major carriers. American's Dire Financial ResultsLet's put some concrete numbers to it, using Q2 results. The company lost $2.7 billion on a pre-tax basis. Excluding special items, it would have lost $4.3 billion from operations. The special items are predominantly the government's targeted employee aid, as American scored $1.8 billion in government funds on that front.So, from operating its largely empty airplanes, American lost $4.3 billion in a three-month span, or nearly $50 million a day in operations.Thanks to getting to claw back taxes as it is now losing money, the overall net loss was $3.4 billion, or $8/share - nearly $3 a share of loss per month. As a reminder, AAL stock is trading at around $14. So five months of this, and the equity would reach zero, assuming it's theoretically worth $14 now.However, thanks to the government aid, American only lost $2.1 billion ($5 a share) instead of $3.4 billion over the past three months. At $5/share of losses per quarter, American will burn through its remaining equity value by spring of 2021. Not a big difference, really.Put another way, even with the government's most generous assistance in Q2, and also including the retroactive tax benefits - all-in - American still lost more than $23 million each and every day. Won't Get Much Better SoonAirline traffic is running around of 30% of capacity. So airlines are losing money at gargantuan proportions now. Analysts such as Moody's suggest that airlines may get back to 50% to 60% of 2019 traffic levels relatively quickly and then spend years reclaiming the rest of the share. Importantly, the most valuable traffic - high-spending business - has barely come back at all.American's book value is negative $7 per share. Meaning that if you suspended operations, sold the brand and assets to outsiders and paid off creditors, you'd have nothing left over. Not only that, you'd have $5 billion of American's outstanding liabilities that wouldn't get paid either. And even that book value is probably optimistic.What do you think airline assets would fetch at an auction in today's environment?That is to say, American is deeply insolvent. And every passing day, it runs up tens of millions more of additional debt. It will be years - maybe 2023 or 2024 - before airlines can dream of operating at great profitability again. AAL Stock VerdictWho is going to string American and its billions of dollars of net liabilities along? The government may give it more money for a few more months, but that's only targeted at saving employee jobs. As demonstrated above, even the government's huge bailout in Q2 barely dented American's prodigious losses.American is insolvent and likely faces bankruptcy down the line. This is in contrast to other operators. Airlines like Southwest (NYSE:LUV) and Delta are salvageable because they have meaningfully positive book values. The equity slice is still worth something. When the government puts more money in, it adds more cushion before the equity value erodes away to zero.With American, however, the equity is under water due to all the debt. Not only that, creditors are going to suffer huge losses - $5 billion or more if American went broke today, and it will get worse with every passing day.The bond market recognizes this. American's 5% debt maturing in 2022 trades at just 66 cents on the dollar as of this writing. That works out to an annualized interest rate of more than 30% for anyone brave enough to buy that offering. Needless to say, when a company's bonds are yielding 30%, there's a good chance the stock is not long for this world.Odds favor American being restructured in coming months or years. As such, investors should avoid American stock.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.For those who don't have the time to tune in live or listen to the podcast, Benzinga will highlight one stock that merits further discussion. This analysis is not a buy or sell recommendation.Russia told the world what we all wanted to here last night: that they have come up with a coronavirus vaccine that will start a Phase 3 clinical trial this week. That's giving a boost to almost all of the \"reopening stocks\" that are so often discussed on the show.One issue getting a lift is American Airlines (NYSE: AAL) and is the PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day.Already Taxiing On The Runway: When trying to pick a bottom in an issue, the first thing that you want to see if it has at least stopped going down. Since peaking on June 5 at $22.80, a top that was spelled out on our June 5 broadcast by co-host Dennis Dick, finally found some institutional buyers at the $11 area in late July and early August.Here is the clip from the June 5 show:In 12 consecutive sessions from July 29 through August 4, the issue made its daily lows between $10.71 to $11.35, which is often a sure sign of the \"big boys\" stepping up to the plate.At Least You Have An Out: When the issue began to lift off last week, it was discussed on the show as a possible long. The reason being if one missed the bottom and decided to purchase the issue in the $12 or $13 handle, a possible exit point could have been the low at the low of the move at $10.71.Just What The Doctor Prescribed For A Rally: Early this morning, Russia made its surprise announcement. Although the top brass in Russia have hinted that one was in the works, it came as a shock that they were the first to come up with a potential vaccine.After Monday's strong close, the news nudged the indexes a bit close to all-time highs. As a result, the \"reopening stocks\" were the ones benefiting most from the unexpected news.Price Action When Being Discussed On The Show: When the issue was being discussed on the show, it was trading in the $15 area. Dennis Dick cautioned about \"chasing the issue up here.\"[I] could not come in and get all excited and buy the stock at these levels, especially since you are buying the issue from investors that purchased the shares in the $11 and $12 area,\" Dick said. \"If you are buying it here off the open, you are doing it wrong.\"Price Action Off The Open: After maintaining the $15 level until the open of the regular session, it managed to reach $15.09, which was just shy of the premarket high ($15.25) and sharply reversed course. The ensuing decline took the issue within 8 cents of Monday's close, bottoming at $14.08.Since reaching that low it has rebounded back into the mid $14 handle as of 12:45 p.m. EST.The full discussion on the issue from today's show can be found here:See more from Benzinga  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: American Airlines(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

(NASDAQ: AAL) moved higher by 58.74% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt American Airlines Group has.American Airlines Group's Debt Based on American Airlines Group's balance sheet as of July 23, 2020, long-term debt is at $28.70 billion and current debt is at $2.58 billion, amounting to $31.27 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $462.00 million in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $30.81 billion.Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. American Airlines Group has $64.54 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.48. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. For example, a debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * Understanding American Airlines Group's Unusual Options Activity  * Return On Capital Employed Overview: American Airlines Group  * Unusual Options Activity Insight: American Airlines Group(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The stock price moved up to $14.45 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-08-21  * Strike Price: $13.50  * Volume: 3731  * Open Interest: 205653 Indications of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume is one way options activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.Another gauge of unusual options activity is a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being \"out of the money\". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Bullish and Bearish Sentiments Options are \"bullish\" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are \"bearish\" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Return On Capital Employed Overview: American Airlines Group  * Unusual Options Activity Insight: American Airlines Group  * American Airlines Group's Debt Overview(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

A relatively high ROCE shows American Airlines Group is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.In American Airlines Group's case, the positive ROCE ratio will be something investors pay attention to before making long-term financial decisions.Q2 Earnings Insight American Airlines Group reported Q2 earnings per share at $-7.82/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $-7.7/share.See more from Benzinga  * Unusual Options Activity Insight: American Airlines Group  * American Airlines Group's Debt Overview  * American Airlines Group: Q2 Earnings Insights(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Since then, though, many measures of activity have leveled off and a key relief program has expired with no agreement on a new deal. The July jobs report also showed that millions of Americans who lost their jobs in the early days of the pandemic remain unemployed, with the overall rate still almost triple the pre-crisis level.\u201cWe\u2019ve had the easy gains and the labor market is becoming a little more difficult now,\u201d said Brett Ryan, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank AG. \u201cGoing forward, the expectation should be a gradual step-down\u201c and \u201cit may not be a straight line in terms of improvement every month.\u201dEmployers added 1.76 million jobs in July, about 300,000 more than economists expected, according to data Friday from the Labor Department. The unemployment rate fell by about 1 percentage point to 10.2%, just above the peak following the 2008 financial crisis but a marked decline from almost 15% at the height of the pandemic.Further job gains are looking increasingly difficult with no vaccine yet in sight, and several signs point to weakness in months ahead: a federal $600 supplement to weekly unemployment benefits, which provided extra cash to prop up households, expired at the end of July. That means fewer dollars spent into the economy and at businesses, which also face the end of funds through the Paycheck Protection Program.The jobless payments are particularly important with millions unemployed for months now. Out of the 16.3 million unemployed Americans in July, almost 8 million had been out of work for 15 weeks or longer, or roughly since the start of the pandemic. That figure was up 4.7 million from June.Meanwhile, negotiations over extending the relief have stalled.\u201cThe talks are rather stalemated right now,\u201d White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Bloomberg Television after the report Friday. Despite that, President Donald Trump plans to use executive orders to get \u201ccertain priorities through\u201d including a payroll tax cut and eviction moratorium, he said. Kudlow continued to call the economic recovery \u201cV-shaped.\u201dBut that recovery is on pause, casting a shadow over the labor market. High-frequency indicators show that economic and payroll activity slowed or declined in the weeks following the survey period for the government\u2019s jobs report, which takes place early in the month.\u201cWhat we have is an economy that\u2019s still adding back but with the slowing in the reopening, we\u2019re setting August up for a very questionable report,\u201d said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economics LLC.Read more: Bloomberg\u2019s TOPLive blog on the jobs reportU.S. equities were mixed on Friday as investors weighed doubts that lawmakers will be able to agree on a new round of economic stimulus with a better-than-forecast jobs report.What Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\u201cFollowing an unprecedented swing from severe drop to sharp rebound, the economy is entering more conventional recession dynamics. A prolonged period of elevated unemployment and subdued participation in the labor market will weigh heavily on income growth, personal spending and top-line growth.\u201d\\-- Yelena Shulyatyeva, Andrew Husby and Eliza WingerClick here for the full noteLow-wage sectors led gains: payrolls at restaurants jumped by half a million, retail trade employment also increased, though at a slower pace, with more than 250,000 jobs added. Health care and social assistance payrolls rebounded as doctors\u2019 offices continued to open and as demand for day care increased.Manufacturing employment rose just 26,000 in July, about one-tenth of forecasts. Auto makers added more than 39,000 workers.Government PayrollsThe report also showed a 241,000 jump in local-government employment, reflecting seasonal adjustments in the education sector.While companies are hiring, including Amazon Inc., Alphabet Inc., Ford Motor Co. and D.R. Horton Inc., layoffs have been piling up in recent weeks, particularly in industries most affected by the pandemic. American Airlines Group Inc. advised that 25,000 jobs are at risk when aid expires and United Airlines Holdings Inc. said it would furlough one-third of its pilots. L Brands Inc., which owns Victoria\u2019s Secret, said it would lay off 15% of its workforce.The July jobs report also showed little improvement for Black Americans, with their unemployment ticking down only slightly to 14.6%, compared with 12.9% for Hispanic workers, and 9.2% for Whites. The jobless rate for women, who carry the most responsibility for childcare and homecare duties, fell to 10.5% and for men it dropped to 9.4%.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/employment-u-increased-more-forecast-124031058.html"}, {"symbol": "AAL", "publishedDate": "2020-08-07 15:44:03", "title": "Charts Say to Avoid American Airlines for Now", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has been one of the more volatile names for the airline industry. Like most, AAL stock was hammered from its 2020 highs, but it led a jaw-dropping rebound from the March lows. Since then, shares have settled down quite a bit as investors have refocused on reality. Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com That reality is, multiple airlines have reported earnings now - including American - and management is telling us that the rebound is stalling. Why? Because novel coronavirus cases are back on the rise. As cases rise, travel trends are plateauing. What once appeared to be a strong and vibrant rebound in travel - for better or for worse - now has waning momentum. Of course, that's not too surprising, but to hear it from management draws concern. For AAL stock, that's bad news. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Breaking Down American AirlinesAmerican Airlines reported earnings in late July and the results were not very good. On the plus side, that didn't really take investors by surprise, as it was pretty clear that Q2 was going to be horrendous for the airlines. The company actually beat on top- and bottom-line expectations, but boy was it ugly. In the report, management talked about ample liquidity, which sat at $10 billion at the end of the quarter. Cash-burn had averaged $55 million a day in the quarter, but was down to $30 million in the month of June.   * 7 Travel Stocks to Buy Banking On Pent-Up DemandThis was the concern though, (bold emphasis added):\"Passenger demand and load factors have improved since bottoming out in April, but continue to be significantly below 2019 levels. While May and June revenue trends were encouraging, demand has weakened somewhat during July as COVID-19 cases have increased and new travel restrictions have been put into place.\"  Click to EnlargeWe have now heard that from multiple management teams, including United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE). Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) CEO said it will be a couple of years before we see a sustainable recovery. If comments from management aren't enough proof, check out the chart of TSA traffic. While it shows a pretty steady recovery from the lows, it has really leveled off in the month of July. That's not good for the industry, whether we're talking about the best players or the worst. On that note, while American is trying its hardest, it doesn't have the same strength as some of the other airlines. Spirit Airlines has cut down its cash burn the most and should be the quickest to turn profitable in the industry. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has the best balance sheet in the group.  Trading AAL Stock  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comThough I said the charts are keeping me out of this one, the reality is everything is keeping me out. But the charts are the main one. That is, unless it can gain some upside momentum. Currently, AAL stock is below all of its major moving averages, while the 20-day moving average continues to act as resistance. Multiple times over the last month, shares tested up into this level, only to be rejected. Put simply, American Airlines stock is having trouble getting off the mat, let alone dancing in the ring. But there are some signs of hope. Support at $11 continues to hold, while shares look like they want to break over resistance. Bears will say the stock looks like it wants to break down though, as a descending triangle takes hold. If AAL stock closes above the 20-day moving average, look for a possible run to the 50-day. Above that puts the July high in play at $14.29. On the flip side, if American can't close above the 20-day, we have to watch for a break of $11. In that case it could put the $9 to $10 area in play and possibly a retest of the May low. At a time where the broader market continues to chug higher, there's no other way to say it: The charts do not indicate AAL stock is a buy at the moment, nor do its fundamentals. Let's wait for more clarity on the technicals. Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Already in 2020, there have been multiple bankruptcies in the sector, including  LATAM, RavnAir, Flybe and Virgin Australia. The latest victim is Virgin Atlantic, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Aug. 4. Virgin's bankruptcy is different, though, because Delta Air Lines  (NYSE:DAL) has a 49% stake in it. The move actually resulted in DAL stock popping 1.8% on the day.  Virgin Atlantic Declares BankruptcySource: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.com The reservations of U.K.-based Virgin Atlantic have plunged by 89% so far in 2020. In the second half of the year, demand has been just 25% of 2019 levels. The airline flies international routes exclusively, which makes it especially vulnerable to the pandemic's travel restrictions.Virgin Atlantic received $1.57 billion as part of a rescue package that was approved in July by its shareholders, including Delta. While Delta would not have contributed additional funding under the deal, it did agree to defer payments owed by Virgin Atlantic. That funding was supposed to have carried the airline through its next 18 months of operation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Aug. 4, Virgin Atlantic filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in U.S. courts. The move will provide relief from creditors while the airline restructures. DAL stock closed up 1.8% on the news.  * 8 5G Stocks to Get Rich Off Our Information Addiction  How is Delta Performing Compared to Other Airlines?We are reaching the point in this crisis where winners and losers in the airline industry are beginning to become clear. The visible losers, of course, are the dozens of smaller regional and international airlines -- including Virgin Atlantic -- that have been forced into bankruptcy.Investors in the big four airlines have been feeling the pain as well. They are all bleeding cash. In the first quarter, Delta was burning $100 million per day. When it released its Q2 results in July, Delta said that by June it had reduced its daily cash burn to $27 million.DAL stock is down 54% so far in 2020, but it is up over 50% from its 52-week low of $17.50. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is down 61% this year, but it is up over 80% from its 2020 low. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has taken a 39% hit so far in 2020, but it has bounced back nearly 50% from its low point. The Bottom Line on DAL StockIs the worst over for Delta? The Virgin Atlantic bankruptcy doesn't look good on the surface,. However, if the firm's  bankruptcy application is approved, it will help to protect Delta's investment in the airline.The next hurdle will be when the government's funding runs out at the end of September and forces airlines to carry out layoffs. And unless the U.S. can get the pandemic under control, international travel is going to be a non-starter this year.Airlines are a risky bet in 2020,  especially with the termination of government support looming.How will the market react to the fallout from layoffs? The reality of the situation may hurt the already fragile airline stocks. On the other hand, InvestorPlace contributor Nicolas Chahine argues that the worst is over for the sector. He makes the point that the Big Four airlines have secured enough credit to keep flying for many months, even if passengers are slow to return. He also contends that three of the stock in the group, including Delta, are buys for long-term growth investors. Other analysts agree with that take. Those polled by CNN Money have an average rating of \"buy\" on DAL stock. Their median 12-month price target of $35.50 is over 30% above the current share price. If the recovery trend continues, Delta will be a bargain at its current levels. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

That is when federal relief for airline labor costs and a ban on layoffs end. Congress is considering giving passenger airlines another $25 billion to avoid layoffs shortly before the Nov. 3 election. \n Last month, American, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, warned 25,000 employees, including about 2,500 pilots, that they could be furloughed, or laid off with rehiring rights.

The airlines were in a state of disarray themselves and they didn't know if they were going to be bringing them back or not.\" \n The company still has about 70,000 bags that weigh 1.25 pounds a piece. \n First-class nuts have been one of the surprise victims of the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has overtaken all aspects of life and sent airlines into a frenzy of how to protect customers and avoid bankruptcy. \n American Airlines stopped serving warm nuts and most other food items to passengers in March, when the COVID-19 pandemic started and airlines were on the front lines of battling the spread of the virus. Now flight attendants pass out a paper bag with a small bottled water, pre-packaged snacks and hand sanitizer. High-profit-margin alcohol sales are offered only on longer-haul flights and only to premium-class customers. \n American Airlines has had to find ways to unload its excess food, too. The Fort Worth-based carrier has donated about 500,000 pounds to food banks nationwide, including...", "url": "https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Texas-company-looks-to-unload-42-excess-tons-of-15449961.php"}, {"symbol": "AAL", "publishedDate": "2020-08-02 18:01:45", "title": "American Airlines offering Apple TV+ shows as free in-flight entertainment - 9to5Mac", "image": "https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/apple-tv-plus-american-airlines.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "site": "https://9to5mac.com", "text": "Apple TV+ is now available on American Airlines for free.

That pushed the combined second-quarter loss of the nation's four biggest airlines to more than $10 billion. \n Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said he was encouraged by a pickup in leisure travel during May and June after the dark days of March and April. Southwest added flights for July and August. \n Then in the last few weeks a surge in U.S. COVID-19 cases caused bookings to fall, Kelly said. Southwest rewrote its August schedule, dropping some flights. \n \"We're just going to have to be prepared to have a lot of volatility and be prepared to make frequent adjustments,\" Kelly said, \"because it's really almost impossible to plan right now.\" \n American - with hub airports in Texas, North Carolina and Arizona and a big operation in Miami - benefited when Sun Belt states eased health restrictions in the spring to boost their economies. Bookings by small and medium businesses in Texas rose from 10,000 in April to 45,000 in June even while corporate bookings were nearly zero, executives said. \n The airline added flights in June and July, hoping to capture an increase in summer leisure travel. The gambit apparently worked. However, after Labor Day about 40% of American's revenue typically comes from business travel. \n \"It's pretty unreasonable at this point to think that we'll be anywhere close to that\" this fall, said Vasu Raja, the airline's chief revenue officer. He said American still plans to increase flying from Dallas-Fort Worth and...", "url": "https://www.ctpost.com/business/article/American-Southwest-add-to-US-airline-industry-s-15428281.php"}, {"symbol": "AAL", "publishedDate": "2020-07-23 20:43:00", "title": "Dow logs 350-point loss as shares of Apple and Microsoft exact heavy toll on the blue-chip index, broader stock market", "image": "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-GN450_aapl_n_ZG_20180731050043.jpg", "site": "marketwatch", "text": "U.S. stocks end Thursday sharply lower, with technology-related giants Apple and Microsoft at the vanguard of a selloff in large-capitalization stocks.", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-futures-rise-as-senate-republicans-make-progress-toward-fresh-coronavirus-aid-package-2020-07-23"}, {"symbol": "AAL", "publishedDate": "2020-07-23 19:47:56", "title": "'Karen' is kicked off plane for refusing to wear mask", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/07/23/20/31119726-0-image-a-39_1595530814860.jpg", "site": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": "A woman has been dubbed a 'Karen' after she was kicked off an American Airlines flight from Ohio to North Carolina on July 19, and the entire plane applauded as she was escorted off.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8554113/Karen-kicked-plane-refusing-wear-mask.html"}, {"symbol": "AAL", "publishedDate": "2020-07-23 19:12:53", "title": "Airlines lose billions as demand 'stalled,' CEOs warn recovery hinges on a coronavirus vaccine", "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106629603-1595516791113-gettyimages-1227229654-em6_2022_2020052590237916.jpeg?v=1595516918", "site": "cnbc", "text": "Airlines are losing billions and expect a sluggish return of demand barring a vaccine or effective coronavirus treatment.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/23/coronavirus-airlines-lose-billions-as-demand-stalled-ceos-warn-recovery-hinges-on-a-vaccine.html"}, {"symbol": "AAL", "publishedDate": "2020-07-23 19:05:24", "title": "American Airlines Earnings: AAL Stock Noses 5% Higher Following Q2 Results", "image": "https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/americanairlines.jpg", "site": "https://investorplace.com", "text": "American Airlines (AAL) earnings for the airline company's second quarter of the year have AAL stock looking up on Thursday.", "url": "https://investorplace.com/2020/07/american-airlines-earnings-boost-aal-stock-up/"}, {"symbol": "AAL", "publishedDate": "2020-07-23 18:43:18", "title": "American Airlines Group Inc.
